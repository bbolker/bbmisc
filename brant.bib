  abstract = {Logistic regression has become increasingly popular for modeling nest success in terms of nest-specific explanatory variables. However, logistic regression models for nest fate are inappropriate when applied to data from nests found at various ages, for the same reason that the apparent estimator of nest success is biased (i.e. older clutches are more likely to be successful than younger clutches). A generalized linear model is presented and illustrated that gives ornithologists access to a flexible, suitable alternative to logistic regression that is appropriate when exposure periods vary, as they usually do. Unlike the Mayfield method (1961, 1975) and the logistic regression method of Aebischer (1999), the logistic-exposure model requires no assumptions about when nest losses occur. Nest survival models involving continuous and categorical explanatory variables, multiway classifications, and time-specific (e.g. nest age) and random effects are easily implemented with the logistic-exposure model. Application of the model to a sample of Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) nests shows that logistic-exposure estimates for individual levels of categorical explanatory variables agree closely with estimates obtained with Johnson (1979) constant-survival estimator. Use of the logistic-exposure method to model time-specific effects of nest age and date on survival of Blue-winged Teal (Anas discors) and Mallard (A. platyrhynchos) nests gives results comparable to those reported by Klett and Johnson (1982). However, the logistic-exposure approach is less subjective and much easier to implement than Klett and Johnson's method. In addition, logistic-exposure survival rate estimates are constrained to the (0,1) interval, whereas Klett and Johnson estimates are not. When applied to a sample of Mountain Plover (Charadrius montanus) nests, the logistic-exposure method gives results either identical to, or similar to, those obtained with the nest survival model in program MARK (White and Burnham 1999). I illustrate how the combination of generalized linear models and information-theoretic techniques for model selection, along with commonly available statistical software, provides ornithologists with a powerful, easily used approach to analyzing nest success.},

  abstract = {Tree species richness, forest structure, and seasonal fluctuations between rainy and dry seasons can strongly affect trophic interactions in forest ecosystems, but the inter- and scale dependence of these variables remains unclear. Using artificial caterpillars ({\textasciitilde}18,000 replicates), we analyzed predation pressure by arthropods, birds, and rodents along a tree species richness gradient across seasons in a subtropical tree diversity experiment (BEF-China). The aim of the study was to test if forest structure, in addition to tree species richness, has an effect on predation pressure and to further specify which structural variables are important in driving predation. We assessed the effects of tree species richness and forest structure at the plot and local neighborhood levels. We also included fine-scale placement covariates, plot size, and topographical covariates of the study site. Forest structure and tree species richness independently and interactively affected predation pressure. The spatial scale was an important determinant for tree species richness and structural effects, extending from within plot scales to the overall heterogeneity of the plots' surrounding environment. For example, the effect of branch density in the local neighborhood depended on both surrounding tree species richness and plot-level vegetation density. Similarly, visibility-enhancing factors increased attacks by arthropods (lack of branches in close surroundings) and by birds (open area), depending on the surrounding vegetation. A comparison of structural measures showed that predation pressure can be addressed in much greater detail with multiple specific structural features than with overall forest complexity. Seasonal change also affected predation pressure, with foliage being a stronger attractant in spring, but also by presumable topography-driven study plot differences in sun exposure and humidity between rainy and dry seasons. Our study demonstrates that predation pressure is not simply a function of tree species richness or structure but is shaped by the interplay of structural elements, spatial scale, and seasonal dynamics along gradients of tree species richness and forest structure. The structural and seasonal effects are important to take into account when addressing how current and future biodiversity loss may change top-down control of herbivory and overall ecosystem functioning.},

  abstract = {Small changes in the environment can have large impacts, leading to `tipping points' or `threshold' effects on populations. Identifying such effects can provide practitioners benchmarks to both minimize negative impacts and foster positive benefits for populations. Nonetheless, identifying thresholds can be challenging as they can vary spatially, temporally, and in their form (i.e., the shape of the threshold). Such variation, if gone undetected, may stymie the identification of reliable conservation benchmarks. We developed Bayesian change-point models that estimate thresholds of environmental effects that can vary in the number, magnitude and form in space and/or time. We applied these models to estimate thresholds in the effects of hydrology on nest survival of an endangered, wetland-dependent bird, the snail kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus). Using data from 2790 nests at nine wetlands spanning the entire U.S. breeding range over a 21-year time period, we contrasted different threshold models for hydrology effects. Overall, both low water and high water, and high rates of change (declining or increasing water levels, recession and ascension, respectively), had negative, threshold effects on nest survival. Change-point models emphasized that the form, extent, and magnitude of thresholds vary across the breeding range. These benchmarks for water management illustrate that nest survival can be potentially increased over three-fold when thresholds are avoided. Furthermore, our results caution that applying incorrect threshold models to environmental problems can lead to inappropriate targets for conservation. Our modeling framework provides a generalizable way to address this issue and reliably estimate the effect of complex change points and their uncertainty on populations.},

  abstract = {Most animals confine their activities to a discrete home range, long assumed to reflect the fitness benefits of obtaining spatial knowledge about the landscape. However, few empirical studies have linked spatial memory to home range development or determined how selection operates on spatial memory via the latter's role in mediating space use. We assayed the cognitive ability of juvenile pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) reared under identical conditions before releasing them into the wild. Then, we used high-throughput tracking to record their movements as they developed their home ranges, and determined the location, timing and cause of mortality events. Individuals with greater spatial reference memory developed larger home ranges. Mortality risk from predators was highest at the periphery of an individual's home range in areas where they had less experience and opportunity to obtain spatial information. Predation risk was lower in individuals with greater spatial memory and larger core home ranges, suggesting selection may operate on spatial memory by increasing the ability to learn about predation risk across the landscape. Our results reveal that spatial memory, determined from abstract cognitive assays, shapes home range development and variation, and suggests predation risk selects for spatial memory via experience-dependent spatial variation in mortality.},

  author = {Heisey, Dennis M and Shaffer, Terry L and White, Gary C},
  abstract = {We consider how nest-survival studies fit into the theory and methods that have been developed for the biostatistical analysis of survival data. In this framework, the appropriate view of nest failure is that of a continuous time process which may be observed only periodically. The timing of study entry and subsequent observations, as well as assumptions about the underlying continuous time process, uniquely determines the appropriate analysis via the data likelihood. We describe how continuous-time hazard-function models form a natural basis for this approach. Nonparametric and parametric approaches are presented, but we focus primarily on the middle ground of weakly structured approaches and how they can be performed with software such as SAS PROC NLMIXED. The hazard function approach leads to complementary log-log (cloglog) link survival models, also known as discrete proportional-hazards models. We show that cloglog models have a close connection to the logistic-exposure and related models, and hence these models share similar desirable properties. We raise some cautions about the application of random effects, or frailty, models to nest-survival studies, and suggest directions that software development might take.},
