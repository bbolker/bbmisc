	abstract = {Verifying the correctness of Bayesian computation is challenging. This is especially true for complex models that are common in practice, as these require sophisticated model implementations and algorithms. In this paper we introduce {\textbackslash}emph\{simulation-based calibration\} (SBC), a general procedure for validating inferences from Bayesian algorithms capable of generating posterior samples. This procedure not only identifies inaccurate computation and inconsistencies in model implementations but also provides graphical summaries that can indicate the nature of the problems that arise. We argue that SBC is a critical part of a robust Bayesian workflow, as well as being a useful tool for those developing computational algorithms and statistical software.},

We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles. We suggest that common trace plots should be replaced with rank plots from multiple chains. Finally, we give concrete recommendations for how these methods should be used in practice.},

	shorttitle = {\${R}{\textasciicircum}*\$},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07900},
	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has transformed Bayesian model inference over the past three decades: mainly because of this, Bayesian inference is now a workhorse of applied scientists. Under general conditions, MCMC sampling converges asymptotically to the posterior distribution, but this provides no guarantees about its performance in finite time. The predominant method for monitoring convergence is to run multiple chains and monitor individual chains' characteristics and compare these to the population as a whole: if within-chain and between-chain summaries are comparable, then this is taken to indicate that the chains have converged to a common stationary distribution. Here, we introduce a new method for diagnosing convergence based on how well a machine learning classifier model can successfully discriminate the individual chains. We call this convergence measure \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$. In contrast to the predominant \${\textbackslash}widehat\{R\}\$, \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ is a single statistic across all parameters that indicates lack of mixing, although individual variables' importance for this metric can also be determined. Additionally, \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ is not based on any single characteristic of the sampling distribution; instead it uses all the information in the chain, including that given by the joint sampling distribution, which is currently largely overlooked by existing approaches. We recommend calculating \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$ using two different machine learning classifiers - gradient-boosted regression trees and random forests - which each work well in models of different dimensions. Because each of these methods outputs a classification probability, as a byproduct, we obtain uncertainty in \$R{\textasciicircum}*\$. The method is straightforward to implement and could be a complementary additional check on MCMC convergence for applied analyses.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to data analysis provides a powerful way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model parameters, and model structure using probability theory. Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},
