  abstract = {Various bootstraps have been proposed for bootstrapping clustered data from one-way arrays. The simulation results in the literature suggest that some of these methods work quite well in practice; the theoretical results are limited and more mixed in their conclusions. For example, McCullagh reached negative conclusions about the use of non-parametric bootstraps for one-way arrays. The purpose of this paper is to extend our understanding of the issues by discussing the effect of different ways of modelling clustered data, the criteria for successful bootstraps used in the literature and extending the theory from functions of the sample mean to include functions of the between and within sums of squares and non-parametric bootstraps to include model-based bootstraps. We determine that the consistency of variance estimates for a bootstrap method depends on the choice of model with the residual bootstrap giving consistency under the transformation model whereas the cluster bootstrap gives consistent estimates under both the transformation and the random-effect model. In addition we note that the criteria based on the distribution of the bootstrap observations are not really useful in assessing consistency.},

  abstract = {The nonparametric, or resampling, bootstrap for a single unstructured sample corresponds to the algebraic operation of monoid composition, with a uniform distribution on the monoid. With this interpretation, the notion of resampling can be extended to designs having a certain group-invariance property. Two types of exchangeable array structures are considered in some detail, namely the one-way layout, and the two-way row-column exchangeable design. Although in both cases there is a unique group under which the sampling distribution of the observations is exchangeable, the choice of monoid is not unique. Different choices of monoid can lead to drastically different, and in some cases quite misleading, inferences.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed effects are considered excellent predictors of cluster-level parameters in various domains. However, previous research has demonstrated that their performance is affected by departures from model assumptions. Given the common occurrence of these departures in empirical studies, there is a need for inferential methods that are robust to misspecifications while remaining accessible and appealing to practitioners. Statistical tools have been developed for cluster-wise and simultaneous inference for mixed effects under distributional misspecifications, employing a user-friendly semiparametric random effect bootstrap. The merits and limitations of this approach are discussed in the general context of model misspecification. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the asymptotic consistency of the methods under general regularity conditions. Simulations show that the proposed intervals are robust to departures from modelling assumptions, including asymmetry and long tails in the distributions of errors and random effects, outperforming competitors in terms of empirical coverage probability. Finally, the methodology is applied to construct confidence intervals for household income across counties in the Spanish region of Galicia.},
