	abstract = {Due to the high complexity of biological data it is difficult to disentangle cellular processes relying only on intuitive interpretation of measurements. A Systems Biology approach that combines quantitative experimental data with dynamic mathematical modeling promises to yield deeper insights into these processes. Nevertheless, with growing complexity and increasing amount of quantitative experimental data, building realistic and reliable mathematical models can become a challenging task: the quality of experimental data has to be assessed objectively, unknown model parameters need to be estimated from the experimental data, and numerical calculations need to be precise and efficient.Here, we discuss, compare and characterize the performance of computational methods throughout the process of quantitative dynamic modeling using two previously established examples, for which quantitative, dose- and time-resolved experimental data are available. In particular, we present an approach that allows to determine the quality of experimental data in an efficient, objective and automated manner. Using this approach data generated by different measurement techniques and even in single replicates can be reliably used for mathematical modeling. For the estimation of unknown model parameters, the performance of different optimization algorithms was compared systematically. Our results show that deterministic derivative-based optimization employing the sensitivity equations in combination with a multi-start strategy based on latin hypercube sampling outperforms the other methods by orders of magnitude in accuracy and speed. Finally, we investigated transformations that yield a more efficient parameterization of the model and therefore lead to a further enhancement in optimization performance. We provide a freely available open source software package that implements the algorithms and examples compared here.},

Researchers are increasingly using this approach to chemical kinetics in the analysis of cellular systems in biology, where the small molecular populations of only a few reactant species can lead to deviations from the predictions of the deterministic differential equations of classical chemical kinetics. After reviewing the supporting theory of stochastic chemical kinetics, I discuss some recent advances in methods for using that theory to make numerical simulations. These include improvements to the exact stochastic simulation algorithm {(SSA)} and the approximate explicit tau-leaping procedure, as well as the development of two approximate strategies for simulating systems that are dynamically stiff: implicit tau-leaping and the slow-scale {SSA.}},

In this paper we show that the assumption of constant parameters in the model leads to quite unrealistic numerical values for these parameters. Moreover the reports published at the time show that plague epidemics in Bombay occurred in fact with a remarkable seasonal pattern every year since 1897 and at least until 1911. So the 1906 epidemic is clearly not a good example of epidemic stopping because the number of susceptible humans has decreased under a threshold, as suggested by Kermack and {McKendrick}, but an example of epidemic driven by seasonality. We present a seasonal model for the plague in Bombay and compute the type reproduction numbers associated with rats and fleas, thereby extending to periodic models the notion introduced by Roberts and Heesterbeek.},

  journal = {Ecology},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {87},
  pages = {1478-1488},
  abstract = {Applying the recent developments of scale transition theory, we demonstrate
	a systematic approach to the problem of scaling up local scale interactions
	to regional scale dynamics with field data. Dynamics on larger spatial
	scales differ from the predictions of local dynamics alone because
	of an interaction between nonlinearity in population dynamics at
	the local scale and spatial variation in density and environmental
	factors over the regional population. Our systematic approach to
	scaling up involves the following five steps. First, define a model
	for dynamics on the local spatial scale. Second, apply scale transition
	theory to identify key interactions between nonlinearity and spatial
	variation that translate local dynamics to the regional scale. Third,
	measure local-scale model parameters to determine nonlinearities
	at local scales. Fourth, measure spatial variation. Finally, combine
	nonlinearity and variation measures to obtain the scale transition.
	Using field data for the dynamics of grazers and periphyton in a
	freshwater stream, we show that scale transition terms greatly reduce
	the growth and equilibrium density of the periphyton population at
	the stream scale compared to rock scale populations, confirming the
	importance of spatial mechanisms to stream-scale dynamics.},

  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied
	populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative
	importance of various potential causes of the cycles, Over the past
	three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number
	of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population
	models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques
	both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models
	to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced
	that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these
	complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches.
	In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem
	of population cycles, using both long-term population time series
	and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology
	of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical
	models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles.
	Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate
	even qualitatively appropriate dynamics, We finish quantifying the
	remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent
	experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using
	modern statistical techniques, Finally, we compare simulated time
	series generated by the models to the observed time series, using
	a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively
	as "probes." The model most similar to the data, as measured by these
	probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent
	the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this
	approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in
	which we know the "true" governing mechanism. Our analysis, which
	uses only a subset of the information available about the population,
	uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach
	might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},

  abstract = {The forest insect pest Bupalus piniarius (pine looper moth) is a classic
	example of a natural population cycle. As is typical for Populations
	that exhibit regular oscillations in density, there are several biological
	mechanisms that are hypothesized to be responsible for the cycles;
	but despite several decades of detailed study there has been no definite
	conclusion as to which mechanism is most important. We evaluated
	three hypotheses for which there was direct experimental evidence:
	(1) food quality (nutritional value of pine needles affected by defoliation);
	(2) parasitoids (trophic interactions with specialist parasitoids),
	and (3) maternal effects (maternal body size affects the performance
	of offspring). We reviewed the empirical evidence for each of these
	hypotheses and expressed each hypothesis in the form of a mechanistic
	dynamic model. We used a nonlinear forecasting approach to fit each
	model to three long-term Population time series in Britain that exhibit
	some degree of regular cycling, and we used parametric bootstrap
	to evaluate the significance of differences between models in their
	goodness of fit to the data. The results differed among the three
	forests: at Culbin, the parasitoid and maternal effects models fit
	equally well; at Roseisle, the food quality and maternal effects
	models fit equally well; and at Tentsmuir, the parasitoid model fit
	best. However, the best-fit parasitism models required that the parasitism
	rate vary between nearly 0 and nearly 1 during a cycle, greatly exceeding
	the range of parasitism rates that have been observed in the field.
	In contrast, the required variation in the observable maternal quality
	variable (pupal mass) was within the range of empirical observations.
	Under mild constraints on the parasitism rate (though allowing a
	much wider range than has been measured in B. piniarius at any location),
	the fit of the parasitism model fell off dramatically. The maternal
	effects model then had uniformly strong support, outperforming the
	constrained parasitism model at all three sites and the food quality
	model at two; it performed slightly better than the food quality
	model at the remaining site. This represents the first system in
	which the maternal effects hypothesis for population cycles has been
	supported by both strong biological and dynamical evidence.},

  abstract = {In many infectious diseases, an unknown fraction of infections produce
	symptoms mild enough to go unrecorded, a fact that can seriously
	compromise the interpretation of epidemiological records. This is
	true for cholera, a pandemic bacterial disease, where estimates of
	the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from
	3 to 100. In the absence of direct evidence, understanding of fundamental
	aspects of cholera transmission, immunology and control has been
	based on assumptions about this ratio and about the immunological
	consequences of inapparent infections. Here we show that a model
	incorporating high asymptomatic ratio and rapidly waning immunity,
	with infection both from human and environmental sources, explains
	50 yr of mortality data from 26 districts of Bengal, the pathogen's
	endemic home. We find that the asymptomatic ratio in cholera is far
	higher than had been previously supposed and that the immunity derived
	from mild infections wanes much more rapidly than earlier analyses
	have indicated. We find, too, that the environmental reservoir (free-living
	pathogen) is directly responsible for relatively few infections but
	that it may be critical to the disease's endemicity. Our results
	demonstrate that inapparent infections can hold the key to interpreting
	the patterns of disease outbreaks. New statistical methods, which
	allow rigorous maximum likelihood inference based on dynamical models
	incorporating multiple sources and outcomes of infection, seasonality,
	process noise, hidden variables and measurement error, make it possible
	to test more precise hypotheses and obtain unexpected results. Our
	experience suggests that the confrontation of time-series data with
	mechanistic models is likely to revise our understanding of the ecology
	of many infectious diseases.},

	The first is that historical epidemics show various `fieldmarks'
	of chaos, such as positive Lyapunov exponents. Second, phase portraits
	reconstructed from real-world epidemiological time series bear a
	striking resemblance to chaotic solutions obtained from certain epidemiological
	models. Both lines of evidence are subject to dispute: the algorithms
	used to look for the fieldmarks can be fooled by short, noisy time
	series, and the same fieldmarks can be generated by stochastic models
	in which there is demonstrably no chaos at all. In the present paper,
	we compare the predictive abilities of stochastic models with those
	of mechanistic scenarios that admit to chaotic solutions. The main
	results are as follows: (i) the mechanistic models outperform their
	stochastic counterparts; (ii) forecasting efficacy of the deterministic
	models is maximized by positing parameter values that induce chaotic
	behaviour; (iii) simple mechanistic models are equal if not superior
	to more detailed schemes that include age structure; and (iv) prediction
	accuracy for monthly notifications declines rapidly with time, so
	that, from a practical standpoint, the results are of little value.
	By way of contrast, next amplitude maps can successfully forecast
	successive changes in maximum incidence one or more years into the

The data cloning ({DC)} method is a new general technique that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms to compute maximum likelihood ({ML)} estimates along with their asymptotic variance estimates for hierarchical models. Despite its generality, the method has two inferential limitations. First, it only provides Wald-type confidence intervals, known to be inaccurate in small samples. Second, it only yields {ML} parameter estimates, but not the maximized likelihood values used for profile likelihood intervals, likelihood ratio hypothesis tests, and information-theoretic model selection. Here we describe how to overcome these inferential limitations with a computationally efficient method for calculating likelihood ratios via data cloning. The ability to calculate likelihood ratios allows one to do hypothesis tests, construct accurate confidence intervals and undertake information-based model selection with hierarchical models in a frequentist context. To demonstrate the use of these tools with complex ecological models, we reanalyze part of Gause's classic Paramecium data with state—space population models containing both environmental noise and sampling error. The analysis results include improved confidence intervals for parameters, a hypothesis test of laboratory replication, and a comparison of the Beverton-Holt and the Ricker growth forms based on a model selection index.},

The test is a likelihood ratio test based on a discrete time stochastic logistic model. The null hypothesis is that the population is undergoing stochastic exponential growth, stochastic exponential decline, or random walk. The distribution of the test statistic under both the null and alternate hypotheses is obtained through parametric bootstrapping. We document the power of the test with extensive simulations and show how some previous tests in the literature for density dependence suffer from either excessive Type I or excessive Type {II} error. The new test appears robust against sampling or measurement error in the observations. In fact, under certain types of error the power of the new test is actually increased. Example analyses of elk (Cervus elaphus) and grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) data sets are provided. The model implies that density-dependent populations do not have a point equilibrium, but rather reach a stochastic equilibrium (stationary distribution of population abundance). The model and associated statistical methods have potentially important applications in conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{{\textbackslash}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

We then used a vaccination model to translate the uncertainty in the model parameters into uncertainty in which of two vaccination strategies would provide a better response to bioterrorism, mass vaccination, or vaccination of social contacts, so-called “trace vaccination.” Our results show that the uncertainty in the model parameters is remarkably high and that this uncertainty has important implications for vaccination strategies. For example, under one plausible scenario, the most likely outcome is that mass vaccination would save ≈100,000 more lives than trace vaccination. Because of the high uncertainty in the parameters, however, there is also a substantial probability that mass vaccination would save 200,000 or more lives than trace vaccination. In addition to providing the best response to the most likely outcome, mass vaccination thus has the advantage of preventing outcomes that are only slightly less likely but that are substantially more horrific. Rigorous estimates of uncertainty thus can reveal hidden advantages of public health strategies, suggesting that formal uncertainty estimation should play a key role in planning for epidemics.},

	abstract = {This tutorial shows how to build, fit, and criticize disease transmission models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and other infectious diseases in a Bayesian framework. Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate both data and prior knowledge into the model estimates. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent. Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, then with a more elaborate transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced topics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational techniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.},

In most of these applications, prior knowledge about the phenomenon being modelled is available. This knowledge allows us to formulate Bayesian models, that is prior distributions for the unknown quantities and likelihood functions relating these quantities to the observations. Within this setting, all inference on the unknown quantities is based on the posterior distribution obtained from Bayes’ theorem. Often, the observations arrive sequentially in time and one is interested in performing inference on-line. It is therefore necessary to update the posterior distribution as data become available. Examples include tracking an aircraft using radar measurements, estimating a digital communications signal using noisy measurements, or estimating the volatility of financial instruments using stock market data. Computational simplicity in the form of not having to store all the data might also be an additional motivating factor for sequential methods.},

	abstract = {Highly nonlinear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly nonlinear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these dif ficulties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood, and state space methods, such as Par ticle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods in order to reach con clusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model misspecification, leading to bias toward sta ble dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem, but, under the correct model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model de velopment and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.

Three main approaches to ABC have been developed, and these are described and compared.

Here, we introduce a novel epidemic model using a latent Hawkes process with temporal covariates for modelling the infections. Unlike other models, we model the reported cases via a probability distribution driven by the underlying Hawkes process. Modelling the infections via a Hawkes process allows us to estimate by whom an infected individual was infected. We propose a Kernel Density Particle Filter (KDPF) for inference of both latent cases and reproduction number and for predicting the new cases in the near future. The computational effort is proportional to the number of infections making it possible to use particle filter type algorithms, such as the KDPF. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm on synthetic data sets and COVID-19 reported cases in various local authorities in the UK, and benchmark our model to alternative approaches.},

We present a new method that makes maximum likelihood estimation feasible for partially-observed nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems (also known as state-space models) where this was not previously the case. The method is based on a sequence of filtering operations which are shown to converge to a maximum likelihood parameter estimate. We make use of recent advances in nonlinear filtering in the implementation of the algorithm. We apply the method to the study of cholera in Bangladesh.

  abstract = {Population cycles have long fascinated ecologists. Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles. Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics. We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques. Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as ``probes.'' The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles. We illustrate this approach by analyzing one of Nicholson's blowfly populations, in which we know the ``true'' governing mechanism. Our analysis, which uses only a subset of the information available about the population, uncovers the correct answer, suggesting that this synthetic approach might be successfully applied to field populations as well.},
