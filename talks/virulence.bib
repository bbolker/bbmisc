  abstract       = {Several evolutionary processes influence virulence,
                   the amount of damage a parasite causes to its host. For
                   example, parasites are favored to exploit their hosts
                   prudently to prolong infection and avoid killing the
                   host. Parasites also need to use some host resources to
                   reproduce and transmit infections to new hosts. Thus
                   parasites face a tradeoff between prudent exploitation
                   and rapid reproduction-a life history tradeoff between
                   longevity and fecundity. Other tradeoffs among
                   components of parasite fitness also influence
                   virulence. For example, competition among parasite
                   genotypes favors rapid growth to achieve greater
                   relative success within the host. Rapid growth may,
                   however, lower the total productivity of the local
                   group by over exploiting the host, which is a
                   potentially renewable food supply. This is a problem of
                   kin selection and group selection. I summarize models
                   of parasite virulence with the theoretical tools of
                   life history analysis, kin selection, and epidemiology.
                   I then apply the theory to recent empirical studies and
                   models of virulence. These applications, to nematodes,
                   to the extreme virulence of hospital epidemics, and to
                   bacterial meningitis, show the power of simple life
                   history theory to highlight interesting questions and
                   to provide a rich array of hypotheses. These examples
                   also show the kinds of conceptual mistakes that
                   commonly arise when only a few components of parasite
                   fitness are analysed in isolation. The last part of the
                   article connects standard models of parasite virulence
                   to diverse topics, such as the virulence of bacterial
                   plasmids, the evolution of genomes, and the processes
                   that influenced conflict and cooperation among the
                   earliest replicators near the origin of life.},

  abstract       = {An important aspect of microparasite biology is the
                   fact that infections are populations of thousands of
                   microbes. As any population, infections are hence
                   subject to two main types of changes: demographic and
                   evolutionary. Here we analyse the consequences of
                   within-host evolutionary changes. We build an
                   epidemiological model where infections are regularly
                   invaded by locally favored mutations affecting various
                   infectious traits (virulence, transmissibility and
                   clearance). Our results are the following. In durable
                   infections, where within-host evolution is an important
                   matter, a drop of transmissibility is only slightly
                   deleterious to the infection, while a reduction of
                   infection lifespan is very costly. In consequence,
                   locally favored mutations reducing transmissibility
                   reach a larger frequency, or even the complete
                   fixation, and the suboptimality accumulated in
                   infections owing to within-host evolution affects more
                   their transmission than their duration. Conversely,
                   taking an infection at random and observing the events
                   of within-host evolution, one is more likely to observe
                   reductions of infection length than reductions of
                   transmissibility, because the mutations affecting
                   transmissibility are often already present in
                   infections. We then discuss the interpretation of these
                   results in terms of deleterious mutations, and we also
                   emphasize that the management of within-host evolution
                   could be used as a novel therapeutic approach to the
                   treatment of infection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

  Volume         = {51},
  Number         = {6},
  Pages          = {1828--1837},
  abstract       = {It is predicted that host exploitation should evolve
                   to maximize parasite fitness and that virulence (
                   parasite-induced host mortality) evolves along with the
                   rate of host exploitation. If the life expectancy of a
                   parasite is short, it is expected to evolve a higher
                   rate of host exploitation and therefore higher
                   virulence because the penalty to the parasite for
                   killing the host is reduced. We tested this hypothesis
                   by keeping for 14 months the horizontally transmitted
                   microsporidian parasite Glugoides intestinalis in
                   mono-clonal host cultures (Daphnia magna) under
                   conditions of high and low host background mortality.
                   High host mortality, and thus parasite mortality, was
                   achieved by replacing weekly 70-80% of all hosts in a
                   culture with uninfected hosts from stock cultures
                   (Replacement lines). In the low-mortality treatment no
                   replacement took place. Contrary to our expectation,
                   parasites from the Replacement lines evolved a lower
                   within-host growth rate and virulence than parasites
                   from the Nonreplacement lines. Across lines we found a
                   strong positive correlation between within-host growth
                   rate and virulence. We did further experiments to
                   answer the question why our data did not support the
                   predictions. Sporophorous vesicles (SVs, spore
                   clusters) were smaller in doubly infected than in
                   singly infected host-gut cells, indicating that
                   competition within cells bears costs for the parasite.
                   Due to our experimental protocol, the average Life span
                   of infections had been much higher in the
                   Nonreplacement lines. Since the number of parasites
                   inside a host increases with the time since infection,
                   long-lasting infections led to high frequencies of
                   multiply infected host-gut cells. Therefore, we
                   speculated that within-cell competition was more severe
                   in the Nonreplacement fines and may have led to
                   selection for accelerated within-host growth. SVs in
                   the Nonreplacement fines were indeed significantly
                   larger. Our results point out that single-factor
                   explanations for the evolution of virulence can lead to
                   wrong predictions and that multiple infections are an
                   important factor in virulence evolution.},

                   host-parasite relationships has been the subject of
                   several publications. In the case of HIV virulence,
                   some authors suggest that the evolution of HIV
                   Virulence correlates with the rate of acquisition of
                   new sexual partners. In contrast some other authors
                   argue that the level of HIV virulence is independent of
                   the sexual activity of the host population. Methods
                   Provide a mathematical model for the study of the
                   potential influence of human sexual behaviour on the
                   evolution of virulence of HIV is provided. Results The
                   results indicated that, when the probability of
                   acquisition of infection is a function both of the
                   sexual activity and of the virulence level of HIV
                   strains, the evolution of HIV virulence correlates
                   positively with the rate of acquisition of new sexual
                   partners. Conclusion It is concluded that in the case
                   of a host population with a low (high) rate of exchange
                   of sexual partners the evolution of HIV virulence is
                   such that the less (more) virulent strain prevails.},

                   parasites and their hosts argues that the mode of
                   parasite transmission is critical to the long-term
                   maintenance of cooperation. Cooperation is not expected
                   to be maintained whenever the chief mode of
                   transmission is horizontal: a parasite's progeny infect
                   hosts unrelated to their parent's host. Cooperation is
                   expected to be maintained if the chief mode of
                   transmission is vertical: a parasite's progeny infect
                   only the parent's host or descendants of that host.
                   This paradigm was tested using bacteria and filamentous
                   bacteriophage (fl). When cells harboring different
                   variants of these phage were cultured so that no
                   infectious spread was allowed, ensuring that all
                   parasite transmission was vertical, selection favored
                   the variants that were most benevolent to the
                   host-those that least harmed host growth rate. By
                   changing the culture conditions so that horizontal
                   spread of the phage was allowed, the selective
                   advantage of the benevolent forms was lost. These
                   experiments thus support the theoretical arguments that
                   mode of transmission is a major determinant in the
                   evolution of cooperation between a parasite and its
                   host.},

                   development of effective preventive measures and drug
                   regimes. Such investigations have been hampered by the
                   difficulty of identifying and observing directly,
                   within live tissues, the multiple key variables that
                   underlay infection processes. Fluorescence microscopy
                   data on intracellular distributions of Salmonella
                   enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) show
                   that, while the number of infected cells increases with
                   time, the distribution of bacteria between cells is
                   stationary (though highly skewed). Here, we report a
                   simple model framework for the intensity of
                   intracellular infection that links the quasi-stationary
                   distribution of bacteria to bacterial and cellular
                   demography. This enables us to reject the hypothesis
                   that the skewed distribution is generated by intrinsic
                   cellular heterogeneities, and to derive specific
                   predictions on the within-cell dynamics of Salmonella

                   implications across pathogen dynamics, evolution, and
                   control, and we develop novel generic guidelines for

  abstract       = {The trade-off hypothesis for the evolution of
                   virulence predicts that parasite transmission stage
                   production and host exploitation are balanced such that
                   lifetime transmission success (LTS) is maximised.
                   However, the experimental evidence for this prediction
                   is weak, mainly because LTS, which indicates parasite
                   fitness, has been difficult to measure. For castrating
                   parasites, this simple model has been modified to take
                   into account that parasites convert host reproductive
                   resources into transmission stages. Parasites that kill
                   the host too early will hardly benefit from these
                   resources, while postponing the killing of the host
                   results in diminished returns. As predicted from
                   optimality models, a parasite inducing castration
                   should therefore castrate early, but show intermediate
                   levels of virulence, where virulence is measured as
                   time to host killing. We studied virulence in an
                   experimental system where a bacterial parasite
                   castrates its host and produces spores that are not
                   released until after host death. This permits
                   estimating the LTS of the parasite, which can then be
                   related to its virulence. We exposed replicate
                   individual Daphnia magna ( Crustacea) of one host clone
                   to the same amount of bacterial spores and followed
                   individuals until their death. We found that the
                   parasite shows strong variation in the time to kill its
                   host and that transmission stage production peaks at an
                   intermediate level of virulence. A further experiment
                   tested for the genetic basis of variation in virulence
                   by comparing survival curves of daphniids infected with
                   parasite spores obtained from early killing versus late
                   killing infections. Hosts infected with early killer
                   spores had a significantly higher death rate as
                   compared to those infected with late killers,
                   indicating that variation in time to death was at least
                   in part caused by genetic differences among parasites.
                   We speculate that the clear peak in lifetime
                   reproductive success at intermediate killing times may
                   be caused by the exceptionally strong physiological
                   trade-off between host and parasite reproduction. This
                   is the first experimental study to demonstrate that the
                   production of propagules is highest at intermediate
                   levels of virulence and that parasite genetic
                   variability is available to drive the evolution of
                   virulence in this system.},

                   associated species-specific nematodes allows the
                   measurement of many parameters which are relevant to
                   testing hypotheses concerning host-parasite ecology and
                   evolution. Within fig wasps species, it is possible to
                   estimate lifetime reproductive success of foundress
                   wasps as a function of presence or absence of nematode
                   parasitism (virulence). Across species, there is a wide
                   range of host population structures which, in turn,
                   results in a range of opportunities for either
                   horizontal or vertical nematode transmission.
                   Therefore, estimates of virulence can be related to
                   opportunities for transmission across a group of
                   closely related hosts and their parasites. Further, the
                   dynamics of the nematode infections over ecological and
                   short-term evolutionary timescales can be monitored,
                   giving added insight into the interpretation of the
                   virulence estimates. Moreover, several scales of longer
                   term evolutionary relationships are either known
                   directly from fossil evidence or can be inferred from
                   molecular data, providing deeper temporal context for
                   the observed patterns. This combination of attributes
                   permits detailed testing of hypotheses concerning the
                   factors that potentially influence the evolution of
                   virulence in host-parasite systems, and further,
                   population and simulation models of the system that
                   incorporate the parameter estimates can clarify the
                   interpretation of how those factors act. There is
                   little evidence suggesting that intermediate and
                   long-term evolutionary relationships explain current
                   levels of virulence. That is, it appears that virulence
                   can change rapidly relative to speciation events, and
                   that the nematodes do not tend to become 'benign over
                   time'. Instead, it appears that host population
                   structure can influence the evolution of parasite
                   virulence by affecting the relative opportunities for
                   horizontal to vertical transmission, which, in turn,
                   influences the relative costs and benefits of virulence
                   to the nematodes. At one level, increased opportunities
                   for horizontal transmission decouple the reproductive
                   interests of the individual nematodes from those of the
                   individual hosts that they are directly parasitizing,
                   thereby reducing the cost of virulence to individual
                   nematodes. At another level, increased opportunities of
                   horizontal transmission also increases the relative
                   frequency of hosts infected by multiple strains of
                   nematodes. This promotes the evolution of more virulent
                   forms by increasing the relative importance of
                   within-host competition among nematode strains, thereby
                   favouring strains that 'eat more host sooner'. An
                   interesting property of the fig-nematode systems is
                   that the proportion of infected hosts does not change
                   dramatically through time. This finding implies that
                   there can be considerable negative effects on survival
                   of infected hosts in addition to the previously
                   documented reductions in fecundity of infected
                   foundresses, because the latter are insufficient to
                   account for the observed stability of wasp infection
                   rates.},

                   between 1984 and 2003) and the virulence markers,
                   controlling for gender, exposure category, age and CD4
                   cell count at entry. Results: We found no correlation
                   between any of the virulence markers and the date of
                   diagnosis. Inspection of short-term trends confirmed
                   that virulence has fluctuated around a stable level
                   over time. Conclusions: The lack of long-term time
                   trends in the virulence markers indicates that HIV-1 is
                   not evolving towards increasing or decreasing virulence
                   at a perceptible rate. Both highly virulent and
                   attenuated strains have apparently been unable to
                   spread at the population level. This result suggests
                   that either the evolution of virulence may be slow or
                   inhibited due to evolutionary constraints, or HIV-1 may
                   have already evolved to optimal virulence in the human
                   host. (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

                   selection predicts that as the coefficient of
                   relatedness between infecting parasites decreases, the
                   benefits of competition to individual genotypes
                   increases. Thus parasites can adjust their behaviour in
                   response to current conditions, higher virulence is
                   predicted in multiple genotype infections. There is
                   limited experimental data, however, regarding the
                   effects of mixed strain infections on host and parasite
                   fitness. We investigated, for a snail-schistosome

                   in host reproductive success and survival. Parasite
                   reproductive rate was also increased in mixed strain

                   to be directly due to the genetic heterogeneity of the
                   parasitic infections resulting in increased host
                   defence costs. Reduced host survival was consistent
                   with an adaptive conditional parasite response.},

                   Various hypotheses have been proposed, all involving
                   opportunities for virus spread (for example,
                   agricultural practices, climate changes, rainforest
                   clearing or air travel). However, the nutritional
                   status of the host, until recently, has not been
                   considered a contributing factor to the emergence of
                   infectious disease. In this review, we show that host
                   nutritional status can influence not only the host
                   response to the pathogen, but can also influence the

                   are common among pathogens, but still unexplored in the
                   case of HIV-1. Here we used primary human cells to
                   study the replicative fitness of primary HIV-1 isolates
                   from untreated patients, comparing historical
                   (1986-1989) and recent samples (2002-2003). Methods:
                   Head-to-head dual virus infection/competition assays
                   were performed in both peripheral blood mononuclear
                   cells and human dendritic cell/T-cell co-cultures with
                   pairs of 12 carefully matched historical and recent
                   HIV-1 isolates from untreated patients. Sensitivity to
                   inhibition by lamivudine (3TC) and TAK-779 of
                   historical and recent R5 HIV-1 isolates was measured in
                   a subset of samples. Results: Overall, the historical
                   HIV-1 out-competed the recent HIV-1 isolates in 176 of
                   238 competitions and in 9 of 12 competitions carefully
                   matched for CD4 cell count. The mean relative
                   replicative fitness (W) of all historical HIV-1 strains
                   was significantly greater than that of recent HIV-1
                   isolates (W1986-1989 = 1.395 and W2002-2003 = 0.545, P
                   < 0.001 (t test)). The more fit viruses (mean W > 1)
                   from 1986-1989 appeared less sensitive to TAK-779 and
                   3TC than did the less fit (mean W < 1) 2002-2003
                   viruses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that HIV-1
                   replicative fitness may have decreased in the human
                   population since the start of the pandemic. This

                   selection pressure on parasites to maximize their
                   transmission determines their optimal host exploitation
                   strategies and thus their virulence. Establishing the
                   adaptive basis to parasite life history traits has
                   important consequences for predicting parasite
                   responses to public health interventions. In this study
                   we examine the extent to which malaria parasites
                   conform to the predicted adaptive trade-off between
                   transmission and virulence, as defined by mortality.
                   The majority of natural infections, however, result in
                   sub-lethal virulent effects (e.g. anaemia) and are
                   often composed of many strains. Both sub-lethal effects
                   and pathogen population structure have been
                   theoretically shown to have important consequences for
                   virulence evolution. Thus, we additionally examine the
                   relationship between anaemia and transmission in single
                   and mixed clone infections. Results: Whereas there was
                   a trade-off between transmission success and virulence
                   as defined by host mortality, contradictory
                   clone-specific patterns occurred when defining
                   virulence by anaemia. A negative relationship between
                   anaemia and transmission success was found for one of
                   the parasite clones, whereas there was no relationship
                   for the other. Notably the two parasite clones also
                   differed in a transmission phenotype (gametocyte sex
                   ratio) that has previously been shown to respond
                   adaptively to a changing blood environment. In
                   addition, as predicted by evolutionary theory, mixed
                   infections resulted in increased anaemia. The increased
                   anaemia was, however, not correlated with any
                   discernable parasite trait (e.g. parasite density) or
                   with increased transmission. Conclusions: We found some
                   evidence supporting the hypothesis that there is an
                   adaptive basis correlating virulence (as defined by
                   host mortality) and transmission success in malaria
                   parasites. This confirms the validity of applying
                   evolutionary virulence theory to biomedical research
                   and adds support to the prediction that partially
                   effective vaccines may select for increasingly virulent
                   malaria parasite strains. By contrast, there was no
                   consistent correlation between transmission and
                   sub-lethal anaemia, a more common outcome of malaria
                   infection. However, overall, the data are not
                   inconsistent with the recent proposal that sub-lethal
                   effects may impose an upper limit on virulence.
                   Moreover, clone specific differences in transmission
                   phenotypes linked to anaemia do suggest that there is
                   considerable adaptive potential relating anaemia and
                   transmission that may lead to uncertain consequences
                   following intervention strategies.},

                   pathogen strains that differ in virulence. The ensuing
                   interaction between these strains can, in theory, be a
                   major determinant of the direction of selection on
                   virulence genes in pathogen populations. Many
                   mathematical analyses of this assume that virulent
                   pathogen lineages have a competitive advantage within
                   coinfected hosts and thus predict that pathogens will
                   evolve to become more virulent where genetically
                   diverse infections are common. Although the
                   implications of these studies are relevant to both
                   fundamental biology and medical science, direct
                   empirical tests for relationships between virulence and
                   competitive ability are lacking. Here we use newly
                   developed strain-specific real-time quantitative
                   polymerase chain reaction protocols to determine the
                   pairwise competitiveness of genetically divergent
                   Plasmodium chabaudi clones that represent a wide range
                   of innate virulences in their rodent host. We found
                   that even against their background of widely varying
                   genotypic and antigenic properties, virulent clones had
                   a competitive advantage in the acute phase of mixed
                   infections. The more virulent a clone was relative to
                   its competitor, the less it suffered from competition.
                   This result confirms our earlier work with parasite
                   lines derived from a single clonal lineage by serial
                   passage and supports the virulence-competitive ability
                   assumption of many theoretical models. To the extent
                   that our rodent model captures the essence of the
                   natural history of malaria parasites, public health
                   interventions which reduce the incidence of mixed

                   duplicity: even if subpopulations are reliably
                   extinction-prone, asynchrony in local extinctions and
                   recolonizations makes global persistence possible(1-8).
                   Migration is a double-edged sword in such cases: too
                   little migration prevents recolonization of extinct
                   patches, whereas too much synchronizes subpopulations,
                   raising the likelihood of global extinction. Both edges
                   of this proverbial sword have been explored by
                   manipulating the rate of migration within experimental
                   populations(1,3-6,8). However, few experiments have
                   examined how the evolutionary ecology of fragmented
                   populations depends on the pattern of migration(5).
                   Here, we show that the migration pattern affects both
                   coexistence and evolution within a community of
                   bacterial hosts (Escherichia coli) and viral pathogens
                   (T4 coliphage) distributed across a large network of
                   subpopulations. In particular, different patterns of
                   migration select for distinct pathogen strategies,
                   which we term 'rapacious' and 'prudent'. These
                   strategies define a 'tragedy of the commons'(9):
                   rapacious phage displace prudent variants for shared
                   host resources, but prudent phage are more productive
                   when alone. We find that prudent phage dominate when
                   migration is spatially restricted, while rapacious
                   phage evolve under unrestricted migration. Thus,
                   migration pattern alone can determine whether a de novo
                   tragedy of the commons is resolved in favour of
                   restraint.},

                   macroscopic (epidemiological dynamics) description of
                   the interaction between the parasite and its host. This
                   approach allows relevant epidemiological traits such as
                   parasite transmission, parasite virulence, and host
                   recovery to emerge from a mechanistic model of acute
                   infection describing the interaction between the
                   parasite and the host immune system. We model the
                   effect of a vaccine as an activator of immunity
                   enhancing the replication rate of lymphocytes, their
                   initial density at infection's initiation, their
                   efficacy to kill the parasite, or their activation

                   Conventional wisdom and most parasite-centred models of
                   the evolution of virulence suppose that risk of host
                   (and, hence, parasite) death imposes selection against
                   more virulent strains. Here we selected for high and
                   low virulence within each of two clones of the rodent
                   malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi on the basis of
                   between-host differences in a surrogate measure of
                   Virulence-loss of live weight post-infection. Despite
                   imposing strong selection for low virulence which
                   mimicked 50-75% host mortality the low virulence lines
                   increased in virulence as much as the high virulence
                   lines. Thus, artificial selection on between-host
                   differences ill virulence was unable to counteract
                   natural selection for increased virulence caused by
                   within-host selection processes. The parasite's asexual
                   replication rate and number of sexual transmission
                   forms also increased in all lines, consistent with
                   evolutionary models explaining high virulence. An upper
                   bound to virulence, though not the asexual replication
                   rate, was apparent, but this bound was nor imposed by
                   host mortality. Thus, we found evidence of the factors
                   assumed to drive evolution of increased virulence, but
                   not those thought to counter this selection.},

                   pathogen such as HIV. The effect of the rate at which
                   hosts acquire new partners is shown to depend
                   critically on the details of the host population's
                   growth pattern, sexual contact rate, and level of
                   infection. At density-limited equilibrium, new partner
                   acquisition rates have no effect on virulence. In an
                   exponentially growing host population, higher partner

  abstract       = {Many parasites evolve to become virulent rather than
                   benign mutualists. One of the major theoretical models
                   of parasite virulence postulates that this is because
                   rapid within-host replication rates are necessary for
                   successful transmission (parasite fitness) and that
                   virulence (damage to the host) is an unavoidable
                   consequence of this rapid replication. Two fundamental
                   assumptions underlying this so-called evolutionary
                   trade-off model have rarely been tested empirically:
                   (1) that higher replication rates lead to higher levels
                   of virulence; and (2) that higher replication rates
                   lead to higher transmission. Both of these
                   relationships must have a genetic basis for this
                   evolutionary hypothesis to be relevant. These
                   assumptions were tested in the rodent malaria parasite,
                   Plasmodium chabaudi, by examining genetic relationships
                   between virulence and transmission traits across a
                   population of eight parasite clones isolated from the
                   wild. Each clone was injected into groups of inbred
                   mice in a controlled laboratory environment, and
                   replication rate (measured by maximum asexual
                   parasitemia), virulence (measured by live-weight loss
                   and degree of anemia in the mouse), and transmission
                   (measured by density of sexual forms, gametocytes, in
                   the blood and proportion of mosquitoes infected after
                   taking a blood-meal from the mouse) were assessed. It
                   was found that clones differed widely in these traits
                   and these clone differences were repeatable over
                   successive blood passages. Virulence traits were
                   strongly phenotypically and genetically (i.e., across
                   clones) correlated to maximum parasitemia thus
                   supporting the first assumption that rapid replication
                   causes higher virulence. Transmission traits were also
                   positively phenotypically and genetically correlated to
                   parasitemia, which supports the second assumption that
                   rapid replication leads to higher transmission. Thus,
                   two assumptions of the parasite-centered trade-off
                   model of the evolution of virulence were shown to be
                   justified in malaria parasites.},

                   a game-theoretic approach. One potential shortcoming of
                   this approach is that it does not allow the prediction
                   of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. Such
                   dynamics are of interest for several reasons: for
                   experimental tests of theory, for the development of
                   useful virulence management protocols, and for
                   understanding virulence evolution in situations where
                   the epidemiological dynamics never reach equilibrium
                   and/or when evolutionary change occurs on a timescale
                   comparable to that of the epidemiological dynamics.
                   Here we present a general theory similar to that of
                   quantitative genetics in evolutionary biology that
                   allows for the easy construction of models that include
                   both within-host mutation as well as superinfection and
                   that is capable of predicting both the short- and
                   long-term evolution of virulence. We illustrate the
                   generality and intuitive appeal of the theory through a
                   series of examples showing how it can lead to
                   transparent interpretations of the selective forces
                   governing virulence evolution. It also leads to novel
                   predictions that are not possible using the
                   game-theoretic approach. The general theory can be used
                   to model the evolution of other pathogen traits as

                   by intra-host mutation of the parasite and competition
                   among different parasite mutants in the same host.
                   During the course of an infection, parasite variants
                   may be generated that have some competitive advantage
                   over the strains that initiated the infection. This
                   intra-host competition may select for a short-term
                   advantage. It can lead to variants without any
                   transmission potential or variants with extremely high
                   virulence. We develop a mathematical model which
                   describes intra- and inter-host parasite evolution. The
                   major conclusions are: (i) intra-host competition
                   generates a virulence polymorphism in the parasite
                   population; (ii) intra-host competition can shift the
                   mean virulence beyond what would maximize the
                   reproductive rate of the parasite in the host
                   population; and (iii) the parasite population can
                   evolve to intermediate levels of virulence even if
                   there is no trade-off between transmission rate and
                   virulence. Our model applies to highly mutating
                   parasites with long infection periods, such as, for
                   example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).},

                   actual evolutionary outcome of immune selection on
                   virulence has not. Using the mouse malaria model,
                   Plasmodium chabaudi, we experimentally tested whether
                   immune pressure promotes the evolution of more virulent
                   pathogens by evolving parasite lines in immunized and
                   nonimmunized ("naive") mice using serial passage. We
                   found that parasite lines evolved in immunized mice
                   became more virulent to both naive and immune mice than
                   lines evolved in naive mice. When these evolved lines
                   were transmitted through mosquitoes, there was a
                   general reduction in virulence across all lines.

                   accelerated the rate of virulence evolution, rendering
                   parasites more dangerous to naive hosts. These results

                   malaria parasite that varied widely in virulence, three
                   of which had been serially blood-stage passaged many

                   parasite cannot raise its transmission rate without
                   causing more harm to its host. However, the existence
                   of such trade-off relationships has recently been
                   challenged. Here, we study how a trade-off can emerge
                   from a model that explicitly incorporates within-host
                   dynamics. We find that the existence and the convexity
                   of the trade-off are robust, which implies a definite
                   level of evolutionarily stable virulence (ESV) for the
                   parasite. However, we also show that the dependence of
                   the ESV on parameter values may be very strong. One
                   possible consequence of this sensitivity is that

                   avirulence based upon reduced host (hence group)
                   survival. Such selection appears to have been an
                   important ingredient in the stabilization of the
                   myxomatosis-rabbit system in Australia, although
                   clearly the evolution of resistance in the rabbit
                   population also played a part. We present a simple
                   mathematical model to demonstrate how easily group
                   selection can (in theory) stabilize a parasite-host
                   system. This model is not meant to be a literal
                   translation of the myxomatosis-rabbit interaction, and
                   in fact intentionally disregards host evolution; its
                   purpose is to isolate the role of group selection in
                   the parasite population. Fenner has established that
                   both interdemic selection and host evolution were
                   important in the stabilization of that system, although
                   our model demonstrates that in theory interdemic
                   selection alone could stabilize the interaction. Our
                   central point is that selection for avirulence in the
                   parasite population is important in the evolution of
                   stability in parasite-host systems (Fenner and Myers
                   1978). The obvious next step, both from the general
                   theoretical viewpoint and specifically with regard to
                   the myxoma-rabbit system, will be to consider models in
                   which both host and parasite are permitted to coevolve.
                   We feel, as do many others, that modeling of
                   coevolution of parasite-host systems has not received
                   the attention deserved in theoretical ecology, and that
                   because of the interdependence of the elements these
                   associations represent much better candidates for such
                   theory than the more popular predator-prey or

	abstract = {Why do parasites harm their hosts? Conventional wisdom holds that because parasites depend on their hosts for survival and transmission, they should evolve to become benign, yet many parasites cause harm. Theory predicts that parasites could evolve virulence (i.e., parasite-induced reductions in host fitness) by balancing the transmission benefits of parasite replication with the costs of host death. This idea has led researchers to predict how human interventions--such as vaccines--may alter virulence evolution, yet empirical support is critically lacking. We studied a protozoan parasite of monarch butterflies and found that higher levels of within-host replication resulted in both higher virulence and greater transmission, thus lending support to the idea that selection for parasite transmission can favor parasite genotypes that cause substantial harm. Parasite fitness was maximized at an intermediate level of parasite replication, beyond which the cost of increased host mortality outweighed the benefit of increased transmission. A separate experiment confirmed genetic relationships between parasite replication and virulence, and showed that parasite genotypes from two monarch populations caused different virulence. These results show that selection on parasite transmission can explain why parasites harm their hosts, and suggest that constraints imposed by host ecology can lead to population divergence in parasite virulence. },

As the number of infections per host depends on the force of infection and the force of infection, in turn, depends on prevailing virulence, evolutionary analysis needs to be integrated with population dynamics. A full-fledged approach requires exceedingly large capacities for bookkeeping of the infection events and is therefore difficult to establish. In this article the host-pathogen interaction is studied for the simple case in which hosts may become at most doubly infected. It appears that evolution and population dynamics give rise to a feedback mechanism. When double infections are frequent, increased virulence is favored; but when pathogens become more virulent, the force of infection will decrease, favoring lower virulence again. Thus, evolutionarily stable strategy {(ESS)} virulence depends on the interaction within hosts as well as on the interaction at the population level. As current models of host-microparasite interactions take only first infections into account, they may be inappropriate for evolutionary analyses, which would require modeling of within-host competition between strains and thus of multiple infections.},

The trade-off hypothesis states that virulence is an unavoidable consequence of parasite transmission; however, since the 1990s, this hypothesis has been increasingly challenged. We discuss the history of the study of virulence evolution and the development of theories towards the trade-off hypothesis in order to illustrate the context of the debate. We investigate the arguments raised against the trade-off hypothesis and argue that trade-offs exist, but may not be of the simple form that is usually assumed, involving other mechanisms (and life-history traits) than those originally considered. Many processes such as pathogen adaptation to within-host competition, interactions with the immune system and shifting transmission routes, will all be interrelated making sweeping evolutionary predictions harder to obtain. We argue that this is the heart of the current debate in the field and while species-specific models may be better predictive tools, the trade-off hypothesis and its basic extensions are necessary to assess the qualitative impacts of virulence management strategies.},

Less studied is what happens during the initial phases of invasion and adaptation. Understanding initial adaptive dynamics is particularly important in the context of emerging diseases in wildlife and humans, for which rapid and accurate intervention may be of the essence. To address the question of virulence evolution in emerging diseases, we employ a simple stochastic modeling framework. As is intuitive, the pathogen strains most likely to emerge are those with the highest net reproductive rates {(R0).} We find, however, that stochastic events shape the properties of emerging pathogens in sometimes unexpected ways. First, the mean virulence of emerging pathogens is expected to be larger in dense host populations and/or when transmission is high, due to less restrictive conditions for the spread of the pathogen. Second, a positive correlation between average virulence and transmissibility emerges due to a combination of drift and selection. We conclude that at least in the initial phases of adaptation, special assumptions about constraints need not be invoked to explain some virulence-transmission correlations and that virulence management practices should consider how residual variation in transmission and virulence can be selected to reduce the prevalence and/or virulence of emerging infectious diseases.},

	title = {On the evolution of virulence and the relationship between various measures of mortality},
	volume = {269},
	abstract = {Smallpox causes roughly 20\% mortality whereas chickenpox causes less than 0.1\%. Most 'verbal' (i.e. non-mathematical) discussions using a mortality deﬁnition of virulence would therefore label smallpox as more virulent. Indeed, the virulence of many diseases is measured using such case mortalities, chi, or related measures such as expected host lifespan, T, or lethal dose, {LDx.} But chi, T and {LDx} are only indirectly related to parasite-induced instantaneous mortality rate, alpha, which is the mortality measure used in much of the theory developed to explain virulence evolution. Here I point out that relatively deadly pathogens can actually have lower values of alpha than benign pathogens, demonstrating that alpha does not, by itself, reﬂect the extent to which a parasite causes host mortality. I present mathematical relationships between alpha and chi, T and {LDx,} and use these to demonstrate that predictions about virulence evolution can be qualitatively altered depending upon which measure is used as the deﬁnition of virulence. Two simple examples are presented to illustrate this point, one of which demonstrates that the well-cited prediction that virulence should evolve to be higher when disease-independent host mortality increases need not hold. This prediction has been made in terms of parasite-induced instantaneous mortality, alpha, but if virulence is measured using case mortality (or T or {LDx)} then this prediction can easily be reversed. Theoretical and empirical researchers must use compatible mortality measures before a productive exchange between the two can take place, and it is suggested that case mortality (or lethal dose) is best suited as a single (mortality) measure of parasite virulence.},

A trade-off between transmissibility and duration of infection appears   to favour viruses of intermediate virulence. We developed a mathematical   model to simulate the dynamics of putative viral genotypes that differ   in their virulence. As a proxy for virulence, we use set-point viral   load {(SPVL)}, which is the steady density of viral particles in blood   during asymptomatic infection. Mutation, the dependency of survival and   transmissibility on {SPVL}, and host effects were incorporated into the   model. The model was fitted to data to estimate unknown parameters, and   was found to fit existing data well. The maximum likelihood estimates of   the parameters produced a model in which {SPVL} converged from any initial   conditions to observed values within 100150 years of first emergence of   {HIV-1.} We estimated the 1) host effect and 2) the extent to which the   viral virulence genotype mutates from one infection to the next, and   found a trade-off between these two parameters in explaining the   variation in {SPVL.} The model confirms that evolution of virulence   towards intermediate levels is sufficiently rapid for it to have   happened in the early stages of the {HIV} epidemic, and confirms that   existing viral loads are nearly optimal given the assumed constraints on   evolution. The model provides a useful framework under which to examine   the future evolution of {HIV-1} virulence.},

	abstract = {Abstract In proposing his genetic feedback mechanism, David Pimentel was one of the first biologists to argue that the reciprocal interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics is an important process regulating population dynamics and ultimately affecting community composition. Although the past decade has seen an increase in research activity on these so-called eco-evolutionary dynamics, there remains a conspicuous lack of compelling natural examples of such feedback. Here we argue that this lack may be due to an inherent difficulty in detecting eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. By examining models of virulence evolution, host resistance evolution, and antigenic evolution, we show that the influence of evolution on ecological dynamics can often be obscured by other ecological processes that yield similar dynamics. We then show, however, that mechanistic models can be used to navigate this, in Pimentel’s words, “devious” course of evolution when effectively combined with empirical data. We argue that these models, improving upon Pimentel’s original mathematical models, will therefore play an increasingly important role in identifying more subtle, but possibly ubiquitous, eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature. To highlight the importance of identifying these potentially subtle dynamics in nature, we end by considering our ability to anticipate the effect of population control strategies in the presence of these eco-evolutionary feedbacks.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryWhy} are some pathogens more virulent than others? Theory predicts that pathogens that ‘keep their host alive’ can sometimes outcompete virulent pathogens in times when transmission to new susceptible hosts is unlikely. Yet, this prospect of finding a new susceptible host changes itself throughout an epidemic. In the early stage of an epidemic susceptible hosts are abundant and virulent pathogens that invest more into horizontal transmission should win the competition. Later on, the spread of the infection reduces the pool of susceptible hosts and may reverse the selection on virulence. This may favor benign pathogens after the acute phase of the epidemic. We model this transient benefit for virulence and predict both the epidemiology and the evolution of pathogens during an epidemic. To put these predictions to the test we monitor the competition of the temperate bacterial virus λ and its virulent mutant {λcI857} in experimental epidemics. Our experimental results agree remarkably well with all our theoretical predictions. This demonstrates the ability of evolutionary epidemiology to predict selection for virulence in an ongoing epidemic.},

As a generalization of the existence theory for equilibria in the constant coefficient case, it is shown that there exists a branch of positive periodic solutions which connects (i.e. bifurcates from) the two nontrivial periodic solutions lying on the coordinate axes. This branch exists for a finite interval or “spectrum” of bifurcation parameter values (the bifurcation parameter being the average of the net inherent growth rate of one species). The stability of these periodic solutions is studied and is related to the theory of competitive exclusion. A specific example of independent ecological interest is examined by means of which it is shown under what circumstances two species, which could not coexist in a constant environment, can coexist in a limit cycle fashion when subjected to suitable periodic harvesting or removal rates.},

This correlation arises because both transmission and disease-induced mortality (i.e. virulence) are increasing functions of parasite within-host density. There is, however, a glaring lack of empirical data to support this hypothesis. Here, we review empirical investigations reporting to what extent within-host viral accumulation determines the transmission rate and the virulence of vector-borne plant viruses. Studies suggest that the correlation between within-plant viral accumulation and transmission rate of natural isolates is positive. Unfortunately, results on the correlation between viral accumulation and virulence are very scarce. We found only very few appropriate studies testing such a correlation, themselves limited by the fact that they use symptoms as a proxy for virulence and are based on very few viral genotypes. Overall, the available evidence does not allow us to confirm or refute the existence of a transmission–virulence trade-off for vector-borne plant viruses. We discuss the type of data that should be collected and how theoretical models can help us refine testable predictions of virulence evolution.},

One potential shortcoming of this approach is that it does not allow the prediction of the evolutionary dynamics of virulence. Such dynamics are of interest for several reasons: for experimental tests of theory, for the development of useful virulence management protocols, and for understanding virulence evolution in situations where the epidemiological dynamics never reach equilibrium and/or when evolutionary change occurs on a timescale comparable to that of the epidemiological dynamics. Here we present a general theory similar to that of quantitative genetics in evolutionary biology that allows for the easy construction of models that include both within?host mutation as well as superinfection and that is capable of predicting both the short? and long?term evolution of virulence. We illustrate the generality and intuitive appeal of the theory through a series of examples showing how it can lead to transparent interpretations of the selective forces governing virulence evolution. It also leads to novel predictions that are not possible using the game?theoretic approach. The general theory can be used to model the evolution of other pathogen traits as well.},

Nearly 5,000 homosexual men volunteered for semiannual interview, physical examination, and laboratory testing in four metropolitan areas. A significant majority of these men in each center (69–83%) reported having 50 or more lifetime sexual partners, and over 80% had engaged in receptive anal intercourse with at least some of their partners in the previous two years. By the time of the participants' initial evaluation (April 1984-April 1985), infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had occurred in higher proportions of men in Los Angeles (51%) and Chicago (43%) than in Baltimore/Washington, DC (31%) and Pittsburgh (21%), presumably as a result of the higher number of partners and proportion with whom these men had engaged in high-risk practices (e.g., receptive anal intercourse).

Information about the importance of stable serodiscordant couples (when one partner is infected but not the other) relative to contacts outside of stable partnerships in spreading disease can aid in designing and targeting interventions. However, the overall importance of within-couple transmission, and the determinants and correlates of this importance, are not well understood. Here, we explore how mechanistic factors – like partnership dynamics and rates of extra-couple transmission – affect various routes of transmission, using a compartmental model with parameters based on estimates from Sub-Saharan Africa. Under our assumptions, when sampling model parameters within a realistic range, we find that infection of uncoupled individuals is usually the predominant route (median 0.62, 2.5%–97.5% quantiles: 0.26–0.88), while transmission within discordant couples is usually important, but rarely represents the majority of transmissions (median 0.33, 2.5%–97.5% quantiles: 0.10–0.67). We find a strong correlation between long-term HIV prevalence and the contact rate of uncoupled individuals, implying that this rate may be a key driver of HIV prevalence. For a given level of prevalence, we find a negative correlation between the proportion of discordant couples and the within-couple transmission rate, indicating that low discordance in a population may reflect a relatively high rate of within-couple transmission. Transmission within or outside couples and among uncoupled individuals are all likely to be important in sustaining heterosexual HIV transmission in Sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, intervention policies should be broadly targeted when practical.},

Model assumptions are formulated in terms of, usually stochastic, behaviour of individuals and then the resulting phenomena, at the population level, are unravelled. Conceptual clarity is attained, assumptions are stated clearly, hidden working hypotheses are attained and mechanistic links between different observables are exposed.

In literally working through this text, the reader acquires modelling skills that are also valuable outside of epidemiology, certainly within population dynamics, but even beyond that. In addition, the reader receives training in mathematical argumentation. The text is aimed at applied mathematicians with an interest in population biology and epidemiology, at theoretical biologists and epidemiologists. Previous exposure to epidemic concepts is not required, as all background information is given. The book is primarily aimed at self-study and ideally suited for small discussion groups, or for use as a course text.},

The model was analysed to clarify the relationship between heterosexual and IVDU transmission and to provide qualitative and quantitative insights into the HIV epidemic in NYC. The results demonstrated the significance of the dynamic interaction of heterosexual and IVDU transmission. Scenario analysis of the model was used to suggest a new explanation for the stabilization of the seroprevalence level that has been observed in the NYC IVDU community; the proposed explanation does not rely upon any IVDU or sexual behavioural changes. Gender-specific risks of heterosexual transmission in IVDUs were also explored by scenario analysis. The results showed that the effect of the heterosexual transmission risk factor on increasing the risk of HIV infection depends upon the level of IVDU. The model was used to predict future numbers of adult and pediatric AIDS cases; a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the confidence intervals on these prediction estimates were extremely wide. This prediction variability was due to the uncertainty in estimating the values of the models' thirty variables (twenty biological-behavioural transmission parameters and the initial sizes of ten subgroups). However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few key variables were significant in contributing to the AIDS case prediction variability; partial rank correlation coefficients were calculated and used to identify and to rank the importance of these key variables. The results suggest that long-term precise estimates of the future number of AIDS cases will only be possible once the values of these key variables have been evaluated accurately.},

	abstract = {Why some individuals develop AIDS rapidly whereas others remain healthy without treatment for many years remains a central question of HIV research. An evolutionary perspective reveals an apparent conflict between two levels of selection on the virus. On the one hand, there is rapid evolution of the virus in the host, and on the other, new observations indicate the existence of virus factors that affect the virulence of infection whose influence persists over years in infected individuals and across transmission events. Here, we review recent evidence that shows that viral genetic factors play a larger role in modulating disease severity than anticipated. We propose conceptual models that reconcile adaptive evolution at both levels of selection. Evolutionary analysis provides new insight into HIV pathogenesis.
Background Why some individuals develop AIDS rapidly whereas others remain healthy without treatment for many years remains a central question of HIV research. Of the quantities that predict how quickly an untreated infection progresses, the most widely used is set-point viral load. This measure varies by orders of magnitude between infected individuals and is predictive of infectiousness and time to onset of AIDS. Host factors, predominantly linked to the immune system, are known to influence the set point, but much variation remains unexplained.
A transmission chain with heritable virulence. Individuals infected with HIV show differences in clinical progression. Untreated infections are characterized by viral loads (the viral particle density in the blood) that are relatively stable for years, but they can differ by orders of magnitude between individuals. Host factors clearly influence viral load, but viral loads have also recently been found to correlate among individuals in transmission pairs and chains. This indicates a moderate to strong influence of viral genotype on the viral load. Strikingly, this influence persists for years and across transmission events, despite intense within-host viral evolution. A transmission chain with heritable virulence. Individuals infected with HIV show differences in clinical progression. Untreated infections are characterized by viral loads (the viral particle density in the blood) that are relatively stable for years, but they can differ by orders of magnitude between individuals. Host factors clearly influence viral load, but viral loads have also recently been found to correlate among individuals in transmission pairs and chains. This indicates a moderate to strong influence of viral genotype on the viral load. Strikingly, this influence persists for years and across transmission events, despite intense within-host viral evolution.
Advances We review recent evidence showing that HIV genotype influences the set-point viral load far more than anticipated. Our summary of published estimates suggests that 33\% (95\% confidence interval, 20 to 46\%) of the variation is attributable to the virus. Because set-point viral load is heritable (partially controlled by virus genotype) and is linked to transmissibility, it is likely to have evolved to maintain transmission fitness and may continue to evolve in response to diverse selection pressures. These findings are unexpected and paradoxical because rapid and error-prone viral replication should favor within-host adaptation and rapidly scramble signals of viral genotype as infection progresses, rather than leaving a lasting footprint that is preserved throughout an infection and from one infection to the next in transmission chains.
Outlook We propose that resolving the paradox of heritability of set-point viral load will provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV pathogenesis. To this end, we provide three parsimonious, testable, and nonexclusive explanatory mechanisms. The first states that HIV evolution in virulence genes is more functionally constrained than previously thought. The second proposes that virulence of HIV is mediated through the virus’s capacity to systemically activate target cells in which it can efficiently replicate. The capacity to activate would not be expected to evolve rapidly because it does not provide a specific selective advantage to virus strains that activate more cells; rather, it is an advantage shared by all viruses. The third mechanism implicates the preferential transmission of viruses that are stored in nonreplicating cells or during early infection, and the disproportionate influence on long-term pathogenesis of these early viruses. In addition to these insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis, we believe that this research highlights a major gap in our knowledge of HIV. The identification of the genetic determinants of HIV virulence, which appear to vary between closely related strains of the virus, should be a major priority. Thus, whole-genome association studies that are focused on the virus genome should be pursued and expanded, as well as more functional and mechanistic studies, which could be guided by hypotheses such as those presented here.
HIV Virulence
A major focus of research on HIV is on host responses to infection—understandably, because the virus targets the immune system and because of the interest in vaccine development. In reviewing what little research has been done on viral virulence determinants, Fraser et al. (10.1126/science.1243727) present evolutionary explanations for some of the poorly understood phenomena that mark HIV infection, including long-term survivorship, latency, rapid within-host evolution, and inheritability of between-host virulence.},

	abstract = {It is widely believed that epidemics in new hosts diminish in virulence over time, with natural selection favoring pathogens that cause minimal disease. However, a tradeoff frequently exists between high virulence shortening host survival on the one hand but allowing faster transmission on the other. This is the case in HIV infection, where high viral loads increase transmission risk per coital act but reduce host longevity. We here investigate the impact on HIV virulence of HIV adaptation to HLA molecules that protect against disease progression, such as HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*58:01. We analyzed cohorts in Botswana and South Africa, two countries severely affected by the HIV epidemic. In Botswana, where the epidemic started earlier and adult seroprevalence has been higher, HIV adaptation to HLA including HLA-B*57/58:01 is greater compared with South Africa (P = 7 × 10−82), the protective effect of HLA-B*57/58:01 is absent (P = 0.0002), and population viral replicative capacity is lower (P = 0.03). These data suggest that viral evolution is occurring relatively rapidly, and that adaptation of HIV to the most protective HLA alleles may contribute to a lowering of viral replication capacity at the population level, and a consequent reduction in HIV virulence over time. The potential role in this process played by increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) access is also explored. Models developed here suggest distinct benefits of ART, in addition to reducing HIV disease and transmission, in driving declines in HIV virulence over the course of the epidemic, thereby accelerating the effects of HLA-mediated viral adaptation.},

	abstract = {Objective
The potential for changing HIV-1 virulence has significant implications for the AIDS epidemic, including changing HIV transmission rates, rapidity of disease progression, and timing of ART. Published data to date have provided conflicting results.

Design
We conducted a meta-analysis of changes in baseline CD4+ T-cell counts and set point plasma viral RNA load over time in order to establish whether summary trends are consistent with changing HIV-1 virulence.

Methods
We searched PubMed for studies of trends in HIV-1 prognostic markers of disease progression and supplemented findings with publications referenced in epidemiological or virulence studies. We identified 12 studies of trends in baseline CD4+ T-cell counts (21 052 total individuals), and eight studies of trends in set point viral loads (10 785 total individuals), spanning the years 1984–2010. Using random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated summary effect sizes for trends in HIV-1 plasma viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts.

Results
Baseline CD4+ T-cell counts showed a summary trend of decreasing cell counts [effect=−4.93 cells/µl per year, 95\% confidence interval (CI) −6.53 to −3.3]. Set point viral loads showed a summary trend of increasing plasma viral RNA loads (effect=0.013 log10 copies/ml per year, 95\% CI −0.001 to 0.03). The trend rates decelerated in recent years for both prognostic markers.

Conclusion
Our results are consistent with increased virulence of HIV-1 over the course of the epidemic. Extrapolating over the 30 years since the first description of AIDS, this represents a CD4+ T cells loss of approximately 148 cells/µl and a gain of 0.39 log10 copies/ml of viral RNA measured during early infection. These effect sizes would predict increasing rates of disease progression, and need for ART as well as increasing transmission risk.},

Some untreated patients infected by HIV die within a couple of years, while others survive more than 25 years. To date, it is still unclear whether this variance in the virulence of the infection is due to the host or to the virus genotype. One of the main difficulties in answering this question is that, as for most human diseases, we tend not to know who infected whom. Here, we solve this problem by adopting a phylogenetic approach, which estimates the heritability of species traits on a phylogeny. In our case, species correspond to infected patients and the trait is an infection trait. The phylogeny is obtained from the HIV RNA sequences isolated in each patient. We find that more than half of the variance observed in the set-point viral load—a trait that predicts virulence—is heritable from one infection to the next. This implies that set-point viral load is strongly controlled by the virus genotype. This application of the phylogenetic comparative approach to infectious diseases yields major results for the deciphering of HIV pathogenesis. Future applications to other traits and/or other pathogens will help us to better understand rapidly evolving diseases of humans.},

The heritability of SPVL quantifies how much of the variation in SPVL is due to transmissible viral genetics. There is currently no clear consensus on the value of SPVL heritability, as multiple studies have reported apparently discrepant estimates. Here we illustrate that the discrepancies in estimates are most likely due to differences in the estimation methods, rather than the study populations. Importantly, phylogenetic estimates run the risk of being strongly confounded by unrealistic model assumptions. Care must be taken when interpreting and comparing the different estimates to each other., Set-point viral load (SPVL) is the most used predictor of HIV disease severity., There is an ongoing debate about the importance of host and viral genetic factors to SPVL., The increasing availability of HIV sequence data allows for the use of potentially powerful new phylogenetic tools to investigate the genetic underpinnings of SPVL., The heritability of SPVL in a population can quantify the relative influence of virus and host on the variation in SPVL in the population, but the current reported estimates using a variety of methods, among others phylogenetic methods, are seemingly discordant., In order to make sense of the discrepant estimates, it is necessary to disentangle biases due to the different methods used from true differences in the study populations.},

However, it is often not clear which phenomenological model is appropriate for a given dataset. We compare the performance of four commonly used phenomenological models (exponential, Richards, logistic, and delayed logistic) in estimating initial epidemic growth rates by maximum likelihood, by fitting them to simulated epidemics with known parameters. For incidence data, both the logistic model and the Richards model yield accurate point estimates for fitting windows up to the epidemic peak. When observation errors are small, the Richards model yields confidence intervals with better coverage. For mortality data, the Richards model and the delayed logistic model yield the best growth rate estimates. We also investigate the width and coverage of the confidence intervals corresponding to these fits.},

A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.},

	abstract = {Concerns over bioterrorism and emerging diseases have led to the widespread use of epidemic models for evaluating public health strategies. Partly because epidemic models often capture the dynamics of prior epidemics remarkably well, little attention has been paid to how uncertainty in parameter estimates might affect model predictions. To understand such effects, we used Bayesian statistics to rigorously estimate the uncertainty in the parameters of an epidemic model, focusing on smallpox bioterrorism. We then used a vaccination model to translate the uncertainty in the model parameters into uncertainty in which of two vaccination strategies would provide a better response to bioterrorism, mass vaccination, or vaccination of social contacts, so-called “trace vaccination.” Our results show that the uncertainty in the model parameters is remarkably high and that this uncertainty has important implications for vaccination strategies. For example, under one plausible scenario, the most likely outcome is that mass vaccination would save ≈100,000 more lives than trace vaccination. Because of the high uncertainty in the parameters, however, there is also a substantial probability that mass vaccination would save 200,000 or more lives than trace vaccination. In addition to providing the best response to the most likely outcome, mass vaccination thus has the advantage of preventing outcomes that are only slightly less likely but that are substantially more horrific. Rigorous estimates of uncertainty thus can reveal hidden advantages of public health strategies, suggesting that formal uncertainty estimation should play a key role in planning for epidemics.},

This implies that everybody is all the time at risk of acquiring an infection. These models ignore the fact that the formation of a pair of two susceptibles renders them in a sense temporarily immune to infection as long as the partners do not separate and have no contacts with other partners. The present paper takes into account the phenomenon of pair formation by introducing explicitly a pairing rate and a separation rate. The infection transmission dynamics depends on the contact rate within a pair and the duration of a partnership. It turns out that endemic equilibria can only exist if the separation rate is sufficiently large in order to ensure the necessary number of sexual partners. The classical models are recovered if one lets the separation rate tend to infinity.},

In this population we consider a sexually transmitted disease, which can have different transmission rates in steady and in causal partnerships. We investigate under which conditions an epidemic can occur after introduction of the disease into a population where the process of pair formation and separation is at equilibrium. If there is no recovery we can compute an explicit expression for the basic reproduction ratio R0; if we take recovery into account we can derive a condition for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium which is equivalent to R0 {\textless} 1.

	abstract = {For the spread of an infection without recovery we compare the properties of a model in which contacts are assumed to be instantaneous and every contact is with a new partner to a model with an explicit description of partnership formation and duration. We investigate the dynamic behaviour at the beginning of the epidemic, the exponential growth phase and the endemic equilibrium in a population with a simple demographic process. Comparisons are made with the assumption that the basic reproduction ratio R0 is equal for both models. In a second step we introduce variable infectivity into both models and investigate how that interacts with the process of pair formation and partnership duration. The main results are: If partnership duration is taken into account, then (a) the prevalence may initially decrease, even if R0 {\textgreater} 1; (b) the exponential growth rate is lower than in a model without partnership duration; (c) the endemic equilibrium is higher than in a model without partnership duration. Furthermore we show that for a model with positive partnership duration for one value of R0 one might have more than one corresponding epidemic growth rate and endemic steady state. This implies that one cannot estimate R0 from the endemic level without further information on the partnership process. Finally we demonstrate that even for a very low value of per contact infectivity in the second stage of infection, as has been postulated for HIV-infection, transmission during the second stage may contribute significantly to the spread of the epidemic due to the long duration of the second stage. Therefore, reduction of the high infectivity in the short first stage of infection only affects R0 markedly if average partnership duration is short.},
