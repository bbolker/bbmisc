If there will be twice as much memory for the same price in 18 months, why bother to squeeze a factor of 2 from an application's memory requirements? If the CPU will be twice as fast by then, why bother to shave some running time from a program? In other words, why bother to optimize programs? Isn't it better to just get them running and let Moore's Law take us off the hook when resources are constrained? Randall Hyde argues that optimization is important even when memory and processor double regularly. Trying to do the optimization too early can be a futile time-waster.},

  abstract = {Count data can be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models when observations are correlated in ways that require random effects. However, count data are often zero-inflated, containing more zeros than would be expected from the typical error distributions. We present a new package, glmmTMB, and compare it to other R packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models. The glmmTMB package fits many types of GLMMs and extensions, including models with continuously distributed responses, but here we focus on count responses. glmmTMB is faster than glmmADMB, MCMCglmm, and brms, and more flexible than INLA and mgcv for zero-inflated modeling. One unique feature of glmmTMB (among packages that fit zero-inflated mixed models) is its ability to estimate the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution parameterized by the mean. Overall, its most appealing features for new users may be the combination of speed, flexibility, and its interface's similarity to lme4.},

It is written entirely in R and C/C++. Though still "young" as a project, R torch already has a vibrant community of users and developers. Experience shows that torch users come from a broad range of different backgrounds. This book aims to be useful to (almost) everyone. Globally speaking, its purposes are threefold: Provide a thorough introduction to torch basics -- both by carefully explaining underlying concepts and ideas, and showing enough examples for the reader to become "fluent" in torch Again with a focus on conceptual explanation, show how to use torch in deep-learning applications, ranging from image recognition over time series prediction to audio classification Provide a concepts-first, reader-friendly introduction to selected scientific-computation topics (namely, matrix computations, the Discrete Fourier Transform, and wavelets), all accompanied by torch code you can play with. Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R torch is written with first-hand technical expertise and in an engaging, fun-to-read way.},
