  abstract = {A correlation matrix between three variables has to satisfy certain conditions. Such a matrix essentially contains three numbers and thus can be represented by a point in three dimensions. The set of all possible correlation matrices yields a convex solid body with an uncommon shape. All its cross sections perpendicular to the axes are ellipses. At the same time, its surface contains the vertices and edges of a regular tetrahedron. Another unusual shape is obtained for banded correlation matrices between four variables.},

  abstract = {This paper presents unified and compact equations describing the geometry and the geometric properties of the different types of trochoid. For the first time, the double-generation theorem is expressed in an explicit manner and a complete classification of all trochoids is documented. Unified and compact equations describing the geometric properties of a conjugate envelope are also presented in the paper. A new type of conjugate envelope for a given trochoid is discovered. An important contribution to the existing literature on trochoidal-type machines is the derivation of closed-form parametric equations for nine types of conjugate envelope. These equations provide significant geometrical insight into the design and analysis of trochoidal-type machines. The paper also presents the necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed type 1 conjugate envelope. Finally, the paper includes a detailed discussion of the characteristics and the relationships of the different types of trochoid and conjugate envelope. Zusammenfassung Diese Arbeit presentiert einheitliche and zusammengefasste Gleichungen, die die Geometrie und geometrischen Gr{\"o}ssen verschiedener Trochoiden beschreiben. Zum ersten Mal ist das Doppelgenerationstheorem beschrieben in einer offenen Gleichung und die komplette Klassifikation aller Trochoiden ist dokumentiert. Einheitliche und zusammengesfasste Gleichungen, die die geometrischen Gr{\"o}ssen der konjunktiven Randkurven beschreiben, sind auch gegeben. Eine neue Art von konjunktiver Randkurve wurde gefunden. Ein wichtiger Beitrag zur Literatur der Trochoidmaschinen ist die Entwicklung von geschlossenen Gleichengen f{\"u}r neue Arten von konjunktiven Randkurven. Diese Gleichungen erlauben wichtige geometrische Einsichten in die Entwicklung und Analyse der Trochoidmaschinen. Die Arbeit gibt die notwendigen und gen{\"u}genden Bedingungen f{\"u}r eine geschlossene, Art 1, konjunktive Randkurve. Letztlich beinhalted die Arbeit auch eine detailierte Diskussion der Charakteristiken und Beziehungen verschiedner Typen von Trochoiden und konjunktiven Randkurven.},

  abstract = {The covariance matrix plays an important role in statistical inference, yet modeling a covariance matrix is often a difficult task in practice due to its dimensionality and the non-negative definite constraint. In order to model a covariance matrix effectively, it is typically broken down into components based on modeling considerations or mathematical convenience. Decompositions that have received recent research attention include variance components, spectral decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix logarithm. In this paper we study a statistically motivated decomposition which appears to be relatively unexplored for the purpose of modeling. We model a covariance matrix in terms of its corresponding standard deviations and correlation matrix. We discuss two general modeling situations where this approach is useful: shrinkage estimation of regression coefficients, and a general location-scale model for both categorical and continuous variables. We present some simple choices for priors in terms of standard deviations and the correlation matrix, and describe a straightforward computational strategy for obtaining the posterior of the covariance matrix. We apply our method to real and simulated data sets in the context of shrinkage estimation.},

  abstract = {We give a novel and simple convex construction of three-by-three correlation matrices. This construction reveals the exact shape of the volume for these matrices: it is a tetrahedron point-wise transformed through the sine function. Hence the space of three-by-three correlation matrices is isomorphic to the standard three-simplex, and the matrices can be sampled by placing distributions on the three-simplex. This gives densities on the matrices that are flexible and easily interpreted; these will be useful in Bayesian analysis of correlation matrices. Examples using Dirichlet distributions are provided. We show the uniqueness of the construction, and we also prove that there is no parallel construction for higher order correlation matrices.},

Our visualizations follow the principle of decomposing a covariance matrix into scale parameters and correlations, pulling out marginal summaries where possible and using two and three-dimensional plots to reveal multivariate structure. Visualizing a distribution of covariance matrices is a step beyond visualizing a single covariance matrix or a single multivariate dataset. Our visualization methods are available through the R package VisCov.},
