There are lots of ways to *index* different data structures in R (i.e. extract particular components). It's confusing. I'm going to illustrate some of the possibilities and explain why it's better to use `[[`-indexing rather than one of the other options whenever you can. Most of what appears below is stated either explicitly or implicitly in `help("Extract")`, but good luck figuring it out ...

**tl;dr** you should use `[[` rather than any of the other options when extracting a *single element* (item or column) from a vector or list or data frame.

I use "!!!" below to indicate trouble spots.

**Indexing methods**: 

- `[[` (lists, data frames [DFs], atomic vectors)
- `[` (lists, DFs, atomic vectors, and matrices)
- `$` (lists and DFs)

The overlap between list/DF/matrix indexing methods is not surprising because data frames *are* lists, so anything that works with a list should work with a DF. DFs also look like matrices (but aren't!), so matrix-style indexing usually works. We can also think about `subset()` (including its little-used `select=` argument) and tidyverse's `select()`/`filter()` verbs as indexing methods, but that's beyond the scope of this document. For the moment we will lump tidyverse tibbles in with DFs, although we mention a few important distinctions below.

!!! "vector" is very confusing terminology in R. Technically **lists are vectors too**:

>   A *vector* in R is either an atomic vector i.e., one of the atomic types, see ‘Details’, or of type (‘typeof’) or mode ‘list’ or ‘expression’.

99.5% of the time when R users say "vector" they mean "atomic vector" (i.e. *not* a list).

## examples

Some objects to play with:

```{r ex1}
v <- 1:3  ## atomic vector
vn <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3) ## named vector
m <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3) ## matrix
## named matrix
mn <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3,
             dimnames = list(letters[1:3], LETTERS[1:3]))
## list & named list
L <- list(1, 2, 3)
Ln <- list(a=1, b=2, cc=3)
Ln2 <- list(cc=3, cd = 4, "weird name" = 5)
DF <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
tt <- tibble::tibble(a = 1:3, b = 4:6, c = 7:9)
```

## single brackets `[`

`[` extracts elements of a vector by integer index or character (non-integers are silently truncated). It will extract one or more

```{r b1}
v[1]
vn[1]
vn[1:3]
vn["a"]
try(vn["a":"c"]) ## nice if this worked, but it doesn't
```

Using `[` to access a non-existent element of an atomic vector *silently* returns `NA` ([Inferno 8.2.13][1]); it's easy to miss this. `[[` throws an error instead (hurray!)

```{r}
vn["d"]          ## !!! NA
v[4]             ## !!! ditto
v[1.1]           ## !!! non-integer indices are silently truncated
try(v[[4]])      ## safer.
```

**Assigning** to a nonexistent index *creates* an element, with intervening `NA` values as required (!). `[[`, which is normally safer, doesn't save us here (!!!)

```{r}
v[5] <- 5     ## !!!
v["e"] <- 2   ## !!!
v[[10]] <- 1  ## !!!
print(v)
```

An extreme case (extension and coercion to character type ...)

```{r}
v[1e5] <- "hello"
length(v)
format(object.size(v), unit = "Mb")
```

## Single-bracket indexing of matrices

Less over-accommodating weirdness, but still some traps.

```{r b1b}
m[4]            ## !!! acts as though the matrix is a vector
                ##     (usually not what you want)
m[2,2]          ## best use of [; index a matrix by row & column
mn[,"A"]        ## must use this to extract a column of a matrix
try(mn[,"a"])   ## fails loudly on subscripting error
try(mn[["A"]])  ## !!! can't use this
try(mn[[,"A"]]) ## can't use this
```

R automatically drops dimensions (see [Burns inferno][1] 8.1.44):

```{r dropdim}
dim(mn[,"A"])                ## !!! automatically drops dimensions,
                             ##     returns numeric vector
dim(mn[,"A", drop = FALSE])  ## 
```

This difference can be confusing when you're programming; suppose the columns to extract are specified by the user. If they ask for two columns you get a matrix, if they ask for one you get an atomic vector ...

## Double brackets, atomic vectors

Double brackets are better than single brackets for extracting **single elements** of (atomic) vectors.

```{r dbv}
vn["d"]         ## !!! returns NA: will propagate and cause an error
                ##     later on *or* turn all of your results into NA
try(vn[["d"]])  ## subscript error -- this is good!
vn[1:3]
try(vn[[1:3]])  ## doesn't work
```

## Indexing of lists (and data frames)

Single brackets on *lists* (and data frames) return a *list of length 1* (not an atomic vector): see [Inferno 8.1.54][1]

```{r listex1}
str(DF["a"])          ## still a data frame
is.numeric(DF["a"])   ## !!! FALSE
```
These all work if you want to extract a single column:
```{r listex2}
is.numeric(DF[["a"]]) ## list-like: TRUE
is.numeric(DF$a)      ## list-like: TRUE
is.numeric(DF[,"a"])  ## matrix-like: TRUE
```
On the other hand `is.numeric(DF[,"a", drop = FALSE])` returns a DF (as it should).

What about tibbles?

```{r tibbles}
is.numeric(tt[["a"]])      ## TRUE
is.numeric(tt$a)           ## TRUE
is.numeric(tt[,"a"])       ## FALSE!  drop = FALSE for tibbles
                           ##   this fixes an 'infelicity' with
                           ##   DF indexing design, but can be confusing
is.numeric(tt |> pull(a))  ## approved tidyverse idiom
```

Indexing a non-existent element of a list returns `NULL` rather than `NA` (or error) ([Inferno 8.2.13][1])

The `$`-operator will do partial matching, silently by default ...
```{r partialmatch}
names(Ln)
Ln$c             ## !!! doesn't warn that it's getting 'cc'
options(warnPartialMatchDollar = TRUE)
Ln$c             ## now warns
Ln2$c            ## NULL because ambiguous (cc, cd)
Ln2$`weird name` ## names with spaces etc have to use back-ticks
nm <- "weird name"
                 ## you can't do *indirect reference* with $
Ln2$nm           ## i.e. this doesn't work (returns NULL)
```

`[[` allows *indirect reference* (using the value of a symbol to extract an element), which `$` doesn't (since it is intended as an interactive/programming shortcut):

```{r indref}
Ln2[[nm]]
Ln2[["weird name"]]
## can also create a new list element by indirect reference
newnm <- "a"
Ln2[[newnm]] <- 16
Ln2[["a"]]
Ln2[["c"]]  ## NULL (no partial matching)
```

Unfortunately matrix columns can *only* be indexed by `m[,i]` (`m[[i]]` doesn't work), and matrices *only* have `colnames()`, not `names()` ([Inferno 8.2.40][1]). Matrices *must* be homogeneous (e.g. all-numeric). Save matrices for when you (1) actually want to do linear algebra; (2) want to do efficient rowwise extraction (still not as efficient as columnwise matrix extraction, but much better than working with rows of DFs or tibbles).

Another reason why you should use `data.frame()` rather than `cbind()` in general to combine things column-wise (`cbind()` will automatically coerce all of your data to the most general type:

```{r combine}
m0 <- matrix(1, nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
cbind(m0, "a") ## "a" is automatically recycled
data.frame(m0, newcol = "a")
t1 <- tibble(a = 1:3, b = 2:4)
t2 <- tibble(c = LETTERS[1:3])
## combines these but result is a data frame, not a tibble
data.frame(t1, t2)
tibble(t1, t2)
bind_cols(t1, t2)  ## *NOT* like cbind() - doesn't coerce
```

## negative indexing gotchas

Negative indices can be convenient for dropping elements, but not always ([Inferno 8.1.11][1]). `x[-which(...)]` can be particularly dangerous ([Inferno 8.1.13][1]).

```{r}
vn[-1]
try(vn[-1:2])       ## !!! `-` has higher precedence than `:`
vn[-(1:2)]          ## this is OK
vn[-which(vn > 4)]  ## !!!
vn[!(vn > 4)]       ## this works
vn[vn <= 3]         ## this is clearer
```

Negative indexing doesn't work with element names (except maybe in `subset`)

```{r}
try(vn[-"a"])                    ## !!! oh well
vn[names(vn) != "a"]             ## works but clunky
vn[!names(vn) %in% c("a", "b")]  ## use ! ... %in% to exclude
```

Inferno has more stuff on what happens when you index with `NA` or `NULL` ...
