title: RTMB+mle
---

What would an RTMB-based `bbmle` replacement look like? It should have the following (existing) capabilities:

- specify a model and data (as a function or as a formula), and starting parameters
- fit the model using a choice of optimizers
- package the result and provide a range of downstream S3 methods
- compute profiles
- allow fixed parameters (mapping)
- linear submodels for specified parameters

New features/improvements:

- better handling of complex parameters (i.e. parameters specified as scalar/vector/etc., with `unlist()`
- link functions for parameters and for location/scale args
- linear submodels should allow random effects!

```{r}
mle <- function(form, data, start) {
    
}
```
