These are some of  my opinions about writing.

## general points

"Plain", straightforward writing, using concrete words whenever you can, is good. 

I don't have a particular favorite book on writing. I grew up with/was indoctrinated by Strunk and White in high school. Although S&W's grammar advice is routinely (and justifiably) ridiculed by the linguists at [Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=15509) (LL), their general advice on style is a good starting point - not *always* to be followed, but worth keeping in mind. I also like Orwell's [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/) - also [denigrated by Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=992), also not to be taken as gospel, but (in my opinion) a useful and enjoyable read.

Prefer the active to the passive voice, and language that attributes agency to vague language. (There is a legitimate argument for using the passive voice in methods section, because here you *may* want to give the idea that it's not important *who* followed the procedures; I still prefer the active voice here.) In particular, it's OK to replace "It has been observed that ducks like water (Schmoo et al 2015)" with "Schmoo et al (2015) observed that ducks like water", or (even better) "Ducks like water (Schmoo et al 2015)." Similarly, your results can say "Ducks like water" rather than "We observed that ducks like water"; you

I was brainwashed in high school that "this" should never be used without an antecedent ()

"and" splices:

"effect" is overused and vague. "has a positive effect on", "has a positive impact of", "positively influences" â†’ "increases"

for ecologists: "density-dependence" is vague. I try to avoid *reifying* density dependence (i.e., convert it from a label that describes a class of phenomena to a *thing*). "Density-dependent mortality" (or fecundity or whatever) is better than "density dependence" alone; the more specific you can be (e.g. attributing the effects to competition for limited resources or nest sites or whatever), the better.

## punctuation stuff

I like punctuation that isn't part of a quoted phrase or sentence to be *outside* the quotation marks, even though that's against most English style guides.

## proofreading etc.

Always spell-check. Spell-checking won't catch everything, and you may have to skip over a lot of technical vocabulary that's not in the dictionary, but there's no excuse for not doing it.

When using BibTeX for citations, check for capitalization! Most journal styles automatically *set titles in all lower-case*, so you have to protect any words that should be Capitalized or CAPITALIZED with curly brackets {} (some reference managers automatically {protect} {every} {word} {in} {the} {title}, but I prefer that only necessary words are protected.

When using LaTeX, note that plain double quotes will often get converted to "fancy" quotes incorrectly: use double-single-backquotes `` for open-double-quotes, either double-single-quotes '' or plain double-quotes for close-double-quotes.

## Organization

I often write the introduction last, and almost always write the abstract last.

It sometimes works well to write a first draft and *then* write an outline by reducing the draft you wrote to a skeleton of bullet points.

## Muphry's law

I'm sure that I have violated some of my own rules while writing this document.
