Here are some of  my opinions about writing.

## general points

"Plain", straightforward writing, using concrete words whenever you can, is good. From Robertson Davies' novel *The Manticore* (1972):

> Ramsay always insisted that there was nothing that could not be expressed in the Plain Style if you knew what you were talking about. Everything else was Baroque Style, which he said was not for most people, or Jargon, which was the Devil's work.

I don't have a particular favorite book on writing. I grew up with/was indoctrinated by Strunk and White's *Elements of Style* in high school. Although S&W's grammar advice is routinely (and justifiably) ridiculed by the linguists at [Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=15509) (LL), their general advice on style is a good starting point - not *always* to be followed, but worth keeping in mind. I also like Orwell's [Politics and the English Language](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/) - also [denigrated by Language Log](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=992), also not to be taken as gospel, but (in my opinion) a useful and enjoyable read. (My mother, Joan Bolker, wrote a book on *Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day* and edited an anthology called *The Writer's Home Companion* of essays about writing, but both of them are more about the *process* of writing than about details like word choice and structure.)

Prefer the active to the passive voice, and language that attributes agency to vague language. (There is a legitimate argument for using the passive voice in methods section, because here you *may* want to give the idea that it's not important *who* followed the procedures; I still prefer the active voice here.) In particular, it's OK to replace "It has been observed that ducks like water (Schmoo et al 2015)" with "Schmoo et al (2015) observed that ducks like water", or (even better) "Ducks like water (Schmoo et al 2015)." Similarly, your results can say "Ducks like water" rather than "We observed that ducks like water"; you can assume that your readers know that statements in the results are based on your observations and inferences.

Think about where you want to put the strong point/punch line of a sentence or paragraph. The best location will usually be at the beginning *or* the end - rarely buried in the middle.

Verbs are usually punchier than nouns.

As S&W say, "omit needless words". After you've written something, go through your draft and see what qualifications and waffles you can delete without actually changing the meaning of your sentences.

## More advice

Phrase statements positively rather than negatively: "ducks are likely to be larger in the tropics" rather than "ducks are unlikely to be smaller in the tropics", or "our attempt to catch ducks failed" rather than "our attempt to catch ducks did not succeed". (Orwell specifically recommends avoiding the "not un-" construction.)

I was brainwashed in high school that "this" should never be used without an antecedent ("Ducks are bigger in the tropics. This means that ...") "This" what? Do your best to include an antecedent ("This enlargement means that ..."); it will generally make your writing stronger and more specific.

Avoid redundancy, especially when waffling. Instead of saying "in most cases, ducks tend to be larger" you can say "in most cases, ducks are larger" *or* "ducks tend to be larger"

The verb "to be" is vague and can usually be replaced by something more concrete and specific. "There is/are" is a vague opening.

"may" can often replace "could suggest that" and other waffle-phrases

"and" splices: "and" is often used to connect clauses that are only loosely connected: "ducks are large and when they are approached by humans they make noise". These passages can be stronger if they are split into separate sentences or separated with a semicolon.

"effect" is overused and vague. "has a positive effect on", "has a positive impact of", "positively influences" → "increases".  "Affect" is better than "effect" (verbs stronger than nouns), but even here you should try to use a more specific word ("increases", "decreases"); "increases" is a lot better than "affects positively". I don't like "impacts" as a verb (but I recognize that's old-fashioned/peevish). "Negatively impacts" should be "hurts" or "decreases" or ...

For ecologists: "density-dependence" is vague. I try to avoid *reifying* density dependence (i.e., convert it from a label that describes a class of phenomena to a *thing*). "Density-dependent mortality" (or fecundity or whatever) is better than "density dependence" alone; the more specific you can be (e.g. attributing the effects to competition for limited resources or nest sites or whatever), the better.

A similar example from evolutionary biology: "species X has larger female-biased sexual size dimorphism" → "species X has larger females"

Avoid constructions of the type "A and B have effects C and D, respectively" - you save a few words but the reader has to work harder to associate A with C and B with D

## punctuation

I like punctuation that isn't part of a quoted phrase or sentence to be *outside* the quotation marks, even though that's against most English style guides.

I like to denote the introduction/definition of new technical terms by *italicizing them*. "Large ducks, or *gigantaducks*, are found in the tropics."

Avoid quotation marks except for actual, literal quotations. So-called "scare quotes" are hard to interpret, because they usually mean that you indicate that something shouldn't be taken literally, but it's not precise why or how.

As Jeremy Fox says, [don’t introduce your paper by saying that many people have long been interested in the topic](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2015/04/20/dont-introduce-your-paper-by-talking-about-how-lots-of-people-are-interested-in-the-topic/): "your paper should introduce the biological topic and explain why it’s interesting and important, not say that other people think the topic is interesting and important"

don't use hyphens after adverbs ending with "ly": "partially closed" rather than "partially-closed"

## proofreading etc.

Always spell-check. Spell-checking won't catch everything, and you may have to skip over a lot of technical vocabulary that's not in the dictionary, but there's no excuse for not doing it.

Everyone has punctuation or phrases that they overuse. Learn what yours are, and use your revision process to thin them out.

When using BibTeX for citations, check for capitalization! Most journal styles automatically *set titles in all lower-case*, so you have to protect any words that should be Capitalized or CAPITALIZED with curly brackets {} (some reference managers automatically {protect} {every} {word} {in} {the} {title}, but I prefer that only necessary words are protected.

Not strictly proofreading, but you should have read *every* article or book in your reference section. Thanks to the internet it is now actually plausible that have found a copy of Laplace's "Recherches sur le calcul intégral aux différences infiniment petites, et aux différences finies" (1776) online and read it, but I will definitely challenge you about obscure references during your committee meeting or thesis defense. If you read something in translation, you should cite the translation/translator; if you feel it's important to cite a historical work that's cited in another work, say that explicitly ("Laplace *Recherches sur le calcul ...* [1776], cited in Schmoo et al [2015])

When using LaTeX, note that plain double quotes will often get converted to "fancy" quotes incorrectly: use double-single-backquotes `` for open-double-quotes, either double-single-quotes '' or plain double-quotes for close-double-quotes.

## Words to avoid

- "utili[sz]e" (use "use" instead)
- "hypothesize" (why not just "think" or "suggest"?)
- vague qualifiers: "quite", "very"
- horn-blowing: "importantly", "interestingly". Ideally, your writing will be spare enough that you don't need to emphasize particular results.
- the same goes for "Note that" and "Notably".
- "incredibly" (this is a *very* peeve/niche opinion, but I can't help reading this word with some of its etymological connotation of "unbelievably"; in any case, it's more informal than I like for scientific writing)
- "Additionally": this usually sounds to me like you are making a list and don't know how to motivate the later items more specifically than "and I have another
 thing to tell you"
- avoid contractions ("don't", "won't") in formal writing. 

## Organization

I often write the introduction last, and almost always write the abstract last.

It sometimes works well to write a first draft and *then* write an outline by reducing the draft you wrote to a skeleton of bullet points.

## [Muphry's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muphry%27s_law)

I'm sure that I have violated some of my own rules while writing this document.
