    abstract = {Early warning signals have been proposed to forecast the possibility of a critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a coral reef or the end of a glacial period. Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here, we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces—a statistical error often known as the prosecutor's fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false-positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than those more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely.},

    abstract = {A data-based mathematical model was formulated to assess the epidemiological consequences of heterosexual, intravenous drug use (IVDU) and perinatal transmission in New York City (NYC). The model was analysed to clarify the relationship between heterosexual and IVDU transmission and to provide qualitative and quantitative insights into the HIV epidemic in NYC. The results demonstrated the significance of the dynamic interaction of heterosexual and IVDU transmission. Scenario analysis of the model was used to suggest a new explanation for the stabilization of the seroprevalence level that has been observed in the NYC IVDU community; the proposed explanation does not rely upon any IVDU or sexual behavioural changes. Gender-specific risks of heterosexual transmission in IVDUs were also explored by scenario analysis. The results showed that the effect of the heterosexual transmission risk factor on increasing the risk of HIV infection depends upon the level of IVDU. The model was used to predict future numbers of adult and pediatric AIDS cases; a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the confidence intervals on these prediction estimates were extremely wide. This prediction variability was due to the uncertainty in estimating the values of the models' thirty variables (twenty biological-behavioural transmission parameters and the initial sizes of ten subgroups). However, the sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few key variables were significant in contributing to the AIDS case prediction variability; partial rank correlation coefficients were calculated and used to identify and to rank the importance of these key variables. The results suggest that long-term precise estimates of the future number of AIDS cases will only be possible once the values of these key variables have been evaluated accurately.},

    abstract = {(1) The interaction between the predator Didinium nasutum and its prey Paramecium aurelia was studied in the laboratory. The Paramecium was fed the bacterium Aerobacter aerogenes. (2) The addition of Methyl Cellulose to the culture medium prolonged the coexistence of the species by reducing the rate of ciliate movement and, indirectly, by decreasing the net energy profit of the cells. (3) In the Methyl Cellulose regime, the outcome of the interaction depended upon the concentration of the bacterial nutrient Cerophyl in the medium. The Cerophyl concentration regulates the amount of bacterial food available to the Paramecium and, therefore, can be related to the degree of Paramecium starvation. (4) The efficiency of Didinium as a predator is directly related to the nutritional adequacy of the Paramecium. As the Cerophyl concentration in the medium is reduced and the prey become more starved, the predatory ability of Didinium declines. (5) The type of dynamic behaviour exhibited by the Didinium-Paramecium system at a given Cerophyl concentration is related to the predatory efficiency of Didinium. (6) At low Cerophyl concentrations, the predator and prey coexisted at a numerically stable equilibrium. At intermediate Cerophyl concentrations, although the species coexisted over time, the population densities oscillated with an amplitude related to the Cerophyl level. At high Cerophyl concentrations, the species were unable to coexist. (7) The data was interpreted in terms of the graphical predation theory. The predator and prey zero isoclines were constructed and their points of intersection noted. The comparison of the observed dynamics with those predicted by the graphical model indicated that the theory described the outcome of the Didinium-Paramecium interaction if it was modified to account for time-lags in the response of the predator population to changes in the density of the prey.},

    abstract = {It is well recognized that models in the life sciences can be sensitive to small variations in their model functions, a phenomenon known as ‘structural sensitivity’. Conventionally, modellers test for sensitivity by varying parameters for a specific formulation of the model functions, but models can show structural sensitivity to the choice of functional representations used: a particularly concerning problem when system processes are too complex, or insufficiently understood, to theoretically justify specific parameterizations. Here we propose a rigorous test for the detection of structural sensitivity in a system with respect to the local stability of equilibria, the main idea being to project infinite dimensional function space onto a finite dimensional space by considering the local properties of the model functions. As an illustrative example, we use our test to demonstrate structural sensitivity in the seminal Rosenzweig–MacArthur predator–prey model, and show that the conventional parameter-based approach can fail to do so. We also consider some implications that structural sensitivity has for ecological modelling: we argue that when the model exhibits structural sensitivity but experimental results remain consistent it may indicate that there is a problem with the model construction, and that in some cases trying to find an ‘optimal’ parameterization of a model function may simply be impossible when the model exhibits structural sensitivity. Finally, we suggest that the phenomenon of structural sensitivity in biological models may help explain the irregular oscillations often observed in real ecosystems.},

In controlled laboratory experiments, cultures of flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) undergo bifurcations in their dynamics as demographic parameters are manipulated. These bifurcations, including a specific route to chaos, are predicted by a well-validated deterministic model called the “LPA model”. The LPA model is based on the nonlinear interactions among the life cycle stages of the beetle (larva, pupa and adult). A stochastic version of the model accounts for the deviations of data from the deterministic model and provides the means for parameterization and rigorous statistical validation. The chaotic attractor of the deterministic LPA model and the stationary distribution of the stochastic LPA model describe the experimental data in phase space with striking accuracy. In addition, model-predicted temporal patterns on the attractor are observed in the data. This paper gives a brief account of the interdisciplinary effort that obtained these results.},

Variance in spread rates can be driven exogenously by environmental variability or endogenously by demographic or genetic stochasticity in reproduction, survival, and dispersal. Endogenous variability is likely to be important in spread but has not been studied empirically. We show that endogenously generated variance in spread rates is remarkably high between replicated invasions of the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum in laboratory microcosms. The observed variation between replicate invasions cannot be explained by demographic stochasticity alone, which indicates inherent limitations to predictability in even the simplest ecological settings.

We consider both the local and global dynamics and determine the possible bifurcations with respect to variation of the carrying capacity of the prey, a measure of the enrichment of the environment. We give an analytic expression that determines the criticality of the Hopf bifurcation, and prove that although all three forms can give rise to supercritical Hopf bifurcations, only the Trigonometric form can also give rise to subcritical Hopf bifurcation and has a saddle node bifurcation of periodic orbits giving rise to two coexisting limit cycles, providing a counterexample to a conjecture of Kooji and Zegeling. We also revisit the ranking of the functional responses, according to their potential to destabilize the dynamics of the model and show that given data, not only the choice of the functional form, but the choice of the number and/or position of the data points can influence the dynamics predicted.},

In environmental and biological sciences, the predictive uncertainty of process-based models is usually reduced to parametric uncertainty. Here, we propose a practical approach to tackle the added issue of structural sensitivity, the sensitivity of predictions to the choice between quantitatively close and biologically plausible models. In contrast to earlier studies that presented alternative predictions based on alternative models, we propose a probabilistic view of these predictions that include the uncertainty in model construction and the parametric uncertainty of each model. As a proof of concept, we apply this approach to a predator–prey system described by the classical Rosenzweig–MacArthur model, and we observe that parametric sensitivity is regularly overcome by structural sensitivity. In addition to tackling theoretical questions about model sensitivity, the proposed approach can also be extended to make probabilistic predictions based on more complex models in an operational context. Both perspectives represent important steps towards providing better model predictions in biology, and beyond.},
