title: "estimating parameters of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems"
---

* stoch vs deterministic process; cont vs discrete state (latent and observed); 

* why worry about discreteness of population?
   * mean-variance relation (diffusion models) (Turelli, Lande)
   * fadeout/burnout/absorbing boundaries
   

* process vs observation/measurement noise
   * trajectory matching vs one-step-ahead
   
identifiability issues

* ODEs
* stochastic ODEs
* Gillespie algorithm (Hooke process etc.)

'plug and play'

* Kalman filter
* ensemble Kalman filter etc.

ABC, synthetic likelihood, etc.

Bayesian/frequentist

state space models
