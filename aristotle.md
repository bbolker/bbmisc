### Web search, Crawford and Balon 1996

Web search (yes, Google's AI) leads me to Crawford and Balon 1996 (which I admit I had to get from Sci-hub). They introduce the subject of parental care in fishes by giving a short quote from Gee (1905) who refers to observations by Aristotle. I spent a while searching the text of Aristotle's *History of Animals* (without success) before I dug out the text of Gee 1905, who not only gives enough information to find the information in Aristotle, but later in his paper gives more quotes from Agassiz's translation of Aristotle.

###  Gee 1905

Gee (1905) starts this way:

> Oliver Goldmsith, in 1774, told his readers that "fishes seem, *all* except the whale kind, entirely divested of those parental solicitudes which so strongly mark the manners of the more perfect terrestrial animals." Many to the present time entertain that belief.

> More than a score of centuries before Goldsmith, however, the greatest naturalist of antiquity, Aristotle, told of a kind of fish, inhabiting the largest river of Greece, the Macedonian Achelous, which, in the person of the male parent, exerted the greatest care of both eggs and young ... The strange history of that fish - known to Aristotle as the glanis - will be told at length in later pages of this article ... Although the most detailed history of any fish by any ancient writer is connected with it in the philosopher's History of Animals (...), no reference to it appears in any modern popular work.

Later in the paper Gee gives extensive quotations from Aristotle; here I've copied these from D'Arcy Wentworth's translation which is available online, rather than directly from Gee's paper.

You can get read Gee's paper on the Internet Archive, but I've also posted a PDF at http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/bolker/misc/Gee_1905.pdf.

## Aristotle 

> The glanis or sheat-fish and the perch deposit their spawn in one continuous string, like the frog; ... When the milt has mingled with the eggs, the resulting product becomes very sticky or viscous, and adheres to the roots of trees or wherever it may have been laid. The male keeps on guard at the principal spawning-place, and the female after spawning goes away ... In the case of the sheat-fish the growth from the egg is exceptionally slow, and, in consequence, the male has to keep watch for forty or fifty days to prevent the-spawn being devoured by such little fishes as chance to come by. Next in point of slowness is the generation of the carp. As with fishes in general, so even with these, the spawn thus protected disappears and gets lost rapidly. 

> ... For, with the exception of the sheatfish, no fish keeps on guard; unless, by the way, it be the carp, which is said to remain on guard, if it so happen that its spawn lies in a solid mass. 

(Aristotle does go on to talk about "a species of mullet that grows spontaneously out of mud and sand" ...)

> Of river-fish, the male of the sheat-fish is remarkably attentive to the young. The female after parturition goes away; the male stays and keeps on guard where the spawn is most abundant, contenting himself with keeping off all other little fishes that might steal the spawn or fry, and this he does for forty or fifty days, until the young are sufficiently grown to make away from the other fishes for themselves. The fishermen can tell where he is on guard: for, in warding off the little fishes, he makes a rush in the water and gives utterance to a kind of muttering noise. He is so earnest in the performance of his parental duties that the fishermen at times, if the eggs be attached to the roots of water-plants deep in the water, drag them into as shallow a place as possible; the male fish will still keep by the young, and, if it so happen, will be caught by the hook when snapping at the little fish that come by; if, however, he be sensible by experience of the danger of the hook, he will still keep by his charge, and with his extremely strong teeth will bite the hook in pieces.

Gee mentions that it took until 1856 before the species was described as [Silurus aristotelis, "Aristotle's catfish"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle%27s_catfish)
